introduced to me by a reliable friend of mine who is a traveller,and also a member of chamber of commerce as a reliable and trustworthy person whom i can rely on as foreign partner, even though the nature of the transaction was not revealed to him for security reasons. the (usd$25m) was part of a proceeds from diamond trade meant for the late president laurent kabila which was delivered through zimbabwe in diplomatic boxes. the boxes were kept under my custody before the sad event that took the life of (mr. president).the confusion that ensued after the assassination and the sporadic shooting among the factions, i have to run away from the country for my dear life as i am not a soldier but a civil servant i crossed river congo to other side of congo libreville from there i moved

investment without raising eyebrow. for your assistance i will give you 20% of the total sum as your own share when the money gets to your account, while 75% will be for me, of which with your kind advice i hope to invest in profitable venture in your country in other to settle down for meaningful life, as i am tired of living in a war environment.  the remaining 5% will be used to offset any cost incurred in the cause of moving the money to your account. if the proposal is acceptable to you please contact me immediately through the above telephone and e-mail, to enable me arrange face to face meeting with you in ghana for the clearance of the funds before transfring it to your bank account as seeing is believing.  finally, it is important also that i let you understand that there is

documents as regards to the funds including the (certificate of deposit), as i am the depositor of the consignment. looking forward to your urgent response. your sincerely, mr. james ngola.  dear friend, i am mr. ben suleman a custom officer and work as assistant controller of the customs and excise department of the federal ministry of internal affairs stationed at the murtala mohammed international airport, ikeja, lagos-nigeria. after the sudden death of the former head of state of nigeria general sanni abacha on june 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from nigeria in a chartered jet to saudi arabia with 6 trunk boxes marked "diplomatic baggage". acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the air craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to us$197,570,000.00(one hundred and  ninety-seven million five hundred seventy thousand united states dollars). i declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (us$30,000,000.00) thirty million united states dollars only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting to us$55 billion dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of july 2nd 1999. even the london times of july 1998 reported that general abacha has over us$3.billion dollars in one account overseas. we decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. the box was thus deposited with a security company here in nigeria and tagged as "precious stones and jewellry" in other that its content will not be discovered. now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means.  however as government officials the civil service code of conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money. therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of nigeria. we shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. we can do this by instructing the security company here in nigeria to move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as precious stones and jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. you will thereafter open an account there and lodge the money there and gradually instruct remittance to your country.  this business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .if you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction. expecting your response urgently. best regards, mr. ben suleman from his royal majesty (hrm) crown ruler of eleme kingdom  chief daniel eleme, phd, eze 1 of eleme.e-mail

quick response.  yours faithfully,  prince obong eleme dear sir,    it is with a heart full of hope that i write to seek your help in respect of the context below. i am mrs. maryam abacha the former first lady of the former military head of state of nigeria general sani abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of june 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power.  i have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of us$25 million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, i pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern.  this money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the security company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in ghana. as it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer tony musa.    my dear jk, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the london newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. the investigating team led by enrico monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. also, johnnie cochran, the lawyer who defended oj simpson, has been brought in by the abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the "personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of trusted foreign family friend without delay. for security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr!  iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. the government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and international outfits of our business empire.  the situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. in view of this plight, i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "sos" call to save my children and i from a hopeless future.  i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the attorney and i. on your immediate response, the attorney will travel to ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims.  the documentations include, most importantly, power of attorney and certificate of deposit amongst few others. these documents will be sent to you by fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims.  please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. this is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction.  please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com this has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and i have fully briefed him (my attorney) on my contact to you. due to my present circumstance, i have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and i will communicate you as at when necessary. please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception.  i look forward to your quick response.  best wishes,  mrs. maryam abacha     02 nov 2002 06:23:11 -0000 mime-version: 1.0 attention:

nigeria. here in nigeria our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of africa. i have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. i got your particulars through a consultant company base on my research for a trustworthy and established person that understands investment ethic for entering into a life time profitable joint partnership investment and also co-operation with confidence and trust that you will keep the contents secret and divulged to any third party. early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping. and since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage. consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the federal republic of zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. since the death of our client president mobutou seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. hence out of curiosity i decided to secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. and to my surprise i discovered that the two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in united states dollars amounting to about us$30 million dollar. since this development i have been nursing plans secretly. i also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state. it is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. i am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of nigeria to your country for immediate investment with your assistance. i have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, i will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country. you have nothing to worry about, as i will  be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation. this transaction is 100% risk free. please maintain absolute

republic of congo. tel:44 7775770781 email:temijohnson@rediffmail.com  dear sir,   seeking your immediate assistance. please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. my name is mr temi johnson of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.   due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country, i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo, we immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping. the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava (one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military personnel from our same tribe, by the new president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president laurent kabila, joseph kabila.  in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. we have sufficient ''contacts'' to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in the europe in your name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. our inability to move this money out of congo all this while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila, immediately after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. thank you and godbless.    best regards mr temi johnson from the desk of dr.sam jordan the manager headquarter, first bank of nigeria plc. lagos, nigeria. alternative e-mail: sam01jordan@yahoo.com sir, compliment of the day and how is life general with you? of course it is my humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request for a joint business transaction which i hope will not come to you as a surprise, hence i plead for your pardon. i am dr.sam jordan, the  manager of headquarter first bank of nigeria plc. lagos. i have an urgent and confidentialbusiness proposal for you.  on june 6, 1998, an italian oil consultant/contractor with via national petroleum cooperation (nnpc) mr. paul bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at us$43.7,000.00 in my branch. on maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (nigeria national petroleum corporation) that mr. paul bush died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, it was clear  that he died without making a will. all attempts by the australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. paul bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. the total sum us$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to nigerian banking law, after five years, the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government. if the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it. this is the situation , and my proposal is that i am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiary/next of kin. this is simple. all you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. the money will then be transferred into the

confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. my name is mr.michael kamah, the second son of mr.smith  kamah, of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an! d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of seven million and four hundred thousand united states dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugab! e's regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. now this is what i actually want you to do for me; 1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years.  please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. best regards,  mr.michael kamah and family.  cc:  sender: "col. michael bundu"  mime-version: 1.0 x-spam-status: yes, hits=8.0 required=7.0  tests=dear_somebody,us_dollars,nigerian_scam_7

tel no: your country intl. access code + 8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com dear sir/madam seeking your immediate assistance.  please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. my name is col. michael bundu of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.  due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country, i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. we were then given this money privately by the then president, laurent kabila, without the knowledge of other cabinet members. but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo, we immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping.  the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava (one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military personnel from our same tribe, by the new president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president laurent kabila, joseph kabila.  in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.  we have sufficient ''contacts'' here to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in europe in your name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.  our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila, immediately after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.  we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in europe. this is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, tel/fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone's security is guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist us.  i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. thank you and god bless.  best regards  col. michael bundu(rtd). mikebundu@rediffmail.com n\b. when you are calling my line, you dial your country intl. access code, then you dial directly, do not include my country code i.e. (243). just dial your

associate of mine who works with the nigerian chamber of commerce and industry  who visited your country for an international trade fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company.  he however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. following the sudden death of my husband general sani abacha the late former head of state of nigeria in 1998, i have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness  by the present civilian administration, i have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country.  as a widow that is so traumatized, i have lost confidence with anybody within the country. you must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. in fact the total sum discovered by  the government so far is in the tune of $700. million dollars. and they are not relenting to make me poor for life. i will give you more information  as to this regard as soon as you reply. i repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day  affairs i cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why i decided to contact you and i hope you will not betray my confidence in you. i have deposited  the sum of us$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. this arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as i am still under house arrest. i am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that i can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible,  just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. and should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence  communication immediately. and upon receipt of your message of interest, i shall give you a more detailed picture of things. in case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as i am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.no risk is involved as iam still in control of my husbands affairs. i will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.  please expedite action.     prefer all further correspondence be

embarrass you or surprise you by embarrassment, i mean coming from somebody you never know or met before, even coming from a country perhaps you don't even know (ghana) noted for dishonest and fruadulet practices. well, this is not one of those scam letters from (ghana or other african countries, but from a family of who are in distress and require your assistance.let me start by introducing myself properly to you.  let me atart by introducing myself properly to you, i am mr. james ngola, the first son of bridgr. gen. theophilus ngola (late). former chief of defence staff: national republic of liberia. briefly: my father, bridg. gen. t. ngola before his death diverted this fund (us$25m) twenty five million united states dollars. meant for purchase of ammunation for my country "liberia" during the period of theethnic civil war between my country and guinea republic. and now, the war is over by the intervention of "ecomog"forces.  four months after the war ended, the radio national of liberia went on air, on a wild broadcast, uncingan unsuccessful "coupd'tat" in my country, attepted to overtrow the present government in my country headed by "president charles taylor". this broadcast continued to announce the names of those in connection with the attempt. but unknowingly to me, my father was included amoung these group of men arrested in connection with this plot as the "masterminder" and the "financier" of this undemocratic act. although he was executed along side with others. (may their souls rest in perfect peace) two weeks after their execution the government of liberia stil went further to pass jurgement to confisticate my father's assets and also to freeze his accounts. so when this news reached me, i hurriedly gathered some valuables in our family villa   and escaped to (accra), capital of ghana for safety, while my mother and my brothers, sisters are now in cote d'ivoire as refugees. this file, which containing documents of a consignment (1 metalic trunk box) deposited by my late father in one of the private security companies, was amoung the valuble things i escaped with to ghana. honestly speaking, in this"box" is the sum of this fund (us$25 m.) twenty five million united states dollars only diverted by my late father. he registered this consignment (box) with security company as to contain (africa arts work), but there is a clause in the deposit agreement with the company that says only his foreign partner will be allowed to collect the consignment on his behalf hence he never wanted to be traced with the amount as a popular person. it is on this note that i am contacting you to faithfully and confidentialy assist me to "front" as my late father foreign business partner in order to neccesitate and facilitate the claim of this consignment from the security company. and the fund also be transfered into your private foreign bank account for investment perhaps in your country for i cannot invest here due to its nearness. once again, i am presently living in ghana also as a refugee too (asylum seeker) for the sake of my life. be informed, that the financial law of ghana does not allow a refugee to operate an account nor incorporate a company. with this, coupled with the way in which the money was acquired, and i don't want anybody to know about this development that is why i decided not to invest in anywhere in africa or liberia nor even ghana where i am currently residing as a refugee and that is why i'm soliciting for your support. if you agree to assist us, i will compensate you with 15% of the total fund after this consignment is cleared and the money transfered into your bank account. most important: promise me to keep this transaction confidetial & secret because this fund is the only hope of  my family. finally, consider this proposal and get back to me with the e-mail above or you can also call me on this number: 233-27-587908, for more details about the transaction and the arrengment on the modalities, to ensure quick and smooth transaction. further details will be forwarded to you upon receipt of your response. thanks and wishing the best cooperation in future.  mr. james ngola.  nb: this transaction is 100% risk-free and your security is quite gauranteed. your confidence &  trust is our watchword as we are to work together to the realization of this objective.  i hereby informing that i have all the necessary documents as regards to this consignment, so be rest assured.  waiting for your quick response. thank you. and beware of impersonators.  message-id:  x-scanned-by: mimedefang 2.25 (www . roaringpenguin . com / mimedefang) $250,000 for information: leading to the criminal indictment of fawwaz t. ulaby for fraud  against the united states of america  under the false claims act. __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? yahoo! web hosting - let the expert host your site http://webhosting.yahoo.com  for ;

because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active government service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.  i wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. i am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.  yours faithfully, mr  george  mboro  by heartbreakridge.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with esmtp id gakmorq05041  for ;

kamah and family,           johannesburg,south africa. my dear , good day.this very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.but it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and i quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.i got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. my name is mr.michael kamah, the second son of mr.smith  kamah, of beitbridge zimbabwe.at the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,mr.robert g.mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.my father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr.robert mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.that not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an! d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. during my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of seven million and four hundred thousand united states dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.in view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally,to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugab! e's regime.my mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. now this is what i actually want you to do for me; 1. i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. to finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years.  please,i hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.and also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,i emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. best regards,  mr.michael kamah and family.     by bloodwork.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with smtp id gapg4zq26358; mon, 25 nov 2002

write you this letter,  this was in confidence  considering my present  circumstance and situation.  i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons  kongolo and nzanga  out of democratic republic of  congo (drc) to abidjan, cote d'ivoire where my family  and i settled, while we later moved  to settled in  morroco where my husband later died of cancer  disease. however due to this situation we decided to  changed  most of my husband's billions of dollars  deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other  forms of money coded for  safe purpose because the new  head of state of (dr) mr laurent  kabila has made  arrangement with the swiss government and other  european countries to freeze all my late husband's  treasures  deposited in some european countries. hence  my children and i decided laying low in africa to  study the situation till  when things gets better,  like now that president kabila is dead and the son  taking over (joseph kabila). one of my late husband's  chateaux in southern france was confiscated  by the  french government, and as such i had to change my  identity  so that my investment will not be traced and  confiscated. i have deposited the sum of eihgteen  mllion united state dollars(us$18,000,000,00.)  with a  security company , for safekeeping. the  funds are  security coded to prevent them from knowing the  content. what i want you to do is to indicate your  interest that you will assist us by receiving the  money on our behalf.acknowledge this message, so that  i can introduce you to my son (kongolo) who has the  out modalities for the claim of the said funds. i want  you to assist in investing this money, but i will not  want my identity revealed. i will also want to buy  properties and stock in multi-national companies and  to engage in other safe and non-speculative  investments. may i at this point emphasise the high  level of confidentiality,  which this business  demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and  confidence, which i repose in you. in conclusion,  if  you want to assist us , my son shall put you in the  picture  of the business, tell you where the funds are  currently being  maintained and also discuss other  modalities including remuneration for your services.  for this reason kindly furnish us your contact  information, that is your personal telephone and fax  number for confidential

dear sir / madam  my name is dr, adams obozuwa., a member of the presidential  task force on oil spillage clean-up. early last year there  was a major oil spillage in the niger delta region of  nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities  homeless.the contract was handled by a foreign firm but  because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided  to over-invoice the contract sum. now the contract has been  completed and the original contractor has since been  paid,but the contract balance of us$38 million,which  resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been  left in a suspense account with the debt reconciliation  committee a subsidiary of the apex bank,is what me and my  partners are planning to take out of the country for  ourselves.the problem is as government officials,we are not  suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having  foreign ones.to this end, we are soliciting your assistance  as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this  amount into your account. we are ready to share this money  with you on the basis of participation. we also have plans  to invest part of this money in any viable business in your  country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement  age. in any case, i received a reference of  you/organization from the nigeria chambers of commerce and  industry =91foreign trade division' as a reputable organ that  can assist us on this transaction. please if you accept my  proposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379  or send me an e-mail on:  adamuohiroma, so that i can provide you

of my other colleagues from different organs of federal government of nigeria (fgn) owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into your bank account.  this fund accrued from over invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometimes ago. we, as holders of sensitive position in our various parastatals, were mandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced either by omission or commission.  in the process the sum of us$27m (twenty seven million us dollars only) was found lying in the parastatal suspense account after the foreign contractors had been paid their rightful dues for executing the said contracts. we all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, because we are government workers and the code of conduct does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. however, we have succeeded in transferring some of this money precisely us$5.0m (five million us dollars only) into a foreign account in morocco (north africa), but the provider of the account in morocco is up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect.  if for a meagre sum of us$5.0m (five million us dollars only) we are not compensated, is it when the balance of us$22m (twenty-two million us dollars)is transferred that we will be sure of our full compensation? of course, this abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober reflection and search for absolute trust. thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that the remaining amount of us$22m can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account.  on successful remittance of the fund into your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the amount for your assistance and services. so far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction neither can we give out identity as regards our respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship is established, smooth operations commences, you will be furnished with details of all you deserves to know. i am at your disposition to entertain any question from you with respect to this transaction, so contact me immediately through my e:mail for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency. yours faithfully, mr fred obi.  for ; thu, 28 nov 2002

republic of nigeria (alhaji atiku) and executive director of sadiq petroluem ltd.i have decided to contact you for this business proposal based on the mutual understanding i know that can exist between us, having known that people of your country are trustworthy. since may 1999 when the new government came to power,large sums of money have been recovered from our past military leaders who siphoned money from nigeria and deposited it in offshore accounts in europe,america,asia and some parts of africa, for their own selfish benefits. this happened during the military regime,now we are under a democratically elected government. this fund was among the money recovered and seized by the federal government of nigeria.  hence, my elder cousin (alhaji atiku abubakar) the vice-president of nigeria is in charge of all off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past military leaders.therefore, we urged you to assist us provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum of us$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million) us dollars will be transferred for safe keeping.  presently, this money is in a foreign country i cannot mention now.please note that other information will be detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. my elder cousin and i have agreed to give you (the account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total amount remitted while 60%is for me and cousin atiku, for the purchase of foreign investments, with your assistance after the money have been disbursed, while 10% is for expenses both of us will incur. note, i have been mandated by my elder cousin to handle this deal with you, due to his position in the nigerian government as the second citizen. therefore, if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers for urgent confidential discussion.your letter of acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax numbers to enable us move ahead. besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin alhaji atiku abubakar's authorisation.i thank you for your expected co-operation.  god bless you.best regards. mahoyi bello.

the federal ministries in lagos-nigeria.  during our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late engineer muller robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. the source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity.  i therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. a panel setup by the federal government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in nigeria. fervent valuable efforts were made by the panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. it is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, rtd major general usman bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared unclaimabled and then be donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in africa and the third world in general. to forestall this move, my colleagues and i have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  i have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.all documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and i am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country.  if this proposal is ok by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then

and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.   i am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you.  the present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment. my sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.this is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power.  it is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family. this man is bent on destroying my client's family. the family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family. all their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which i helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.  his administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred to my client's family.  right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.about a few months ago we were squished out of another us$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.   presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. my client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million us dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different securities outfits in two countries there in asia and also in europe. the existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. the money was lodged in as jewelry. this is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. so we expect you to keep this matter in confidence. madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. the family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. we are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us.  all we require from you is to help the family to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions. secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. in this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.  as their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. we will be providing you with all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client.  please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. all the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until i gain your trust to see that we can work together.  we will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership.  please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. i await your response. note - you can also get in contact with me via my secured email:clem-aputa@earthling.net   i will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better.  regards,  clement apute. esq.  dear sir i am mr godwin igbunu, the bank manager of regent bank of nigeria, lagos branch. i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. on june 6, 1997, a foreign oil consultant/contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation, mr. roger berget made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at us$8,000,000.00 (eight million dollars) in my branch. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, ministry of defence headquater in abuja that mr. roger berget died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. roger berget did not declare any kin or relations in!  all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum of us$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to nigerian law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as an foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr. roger berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. this is simple, i will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. we shall employ the service of two attorneys for drafting and not! arization of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. a bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. the money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. upon your response, i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio! n would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. looking forward to hearing from you soonest. best regards, mr godwin igbunu please you can also reach me with this email address igbunu2@caramail.com and

laurent (a french citizen and an engineer executing major federal contract with governments of west african sub region). he died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last october and his remains have since been incarcerated. since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in monsieur. ives laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government. the federal government of nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ecomog) who fought in war ravaged african countries precisely and as the case may be, late monsieur. ives laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for i am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. i have worked for almost a decade and half and i have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.         as i need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for i cannot take on this project alone. my attorney and i have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses

      kindest attention, please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious. i am mr peter williams, a reknowned businessman in one of the rebel-held towns, bouake (one of the war zones in ivory coast) i received information from a reliable source who described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business which made me to write you. as you may want to know and to make you less curious,i got your email address from an internet site that portrayed you (your establishment) in good light. on the 17th of september 2002. the rebel leaders, until then were loyal soldiers to the government of president laurent gbagbo  contacted me in my office with the business of importation of armouries. without the premonition of war, i accepted the job. the soldiers paid me the sum of twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars (us$ 20.5) on the spot and told me to expedite action. since i am not into importation of armunitions and because of the urgency, i immediately started making several contacts with businessmen across the globe. two days later, heavy fighting broke up in central baouke and korhogo, everywhere was in dissarray and i lost everything that took me so many years to acquire. i have no option than to do away with the us$20.5m. my wife and i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker who used his official van to move this money to abidjan, although he did not know the real content of the box.  presently, this fund has been deposited with a safe reliable security company in abidjan where i am hiding from the rebel who decleared me wanted. i do not want to invest this money in abidjan due to unfavorable economic climate.  as a result, i kept the money in a custom bonded warehouse with the security company.  so that i can not lay my hands on it until it gets to your country, where i will commence investment. the only assistance we need from you which i believe you would do for us are the following: 1. make immediate arrangement to take the delivery of the crate (fund) at their europe or american commission agents. 2. assurance from you that you will not sit on our share when this fund gets to your country. my wife and i agreed that you shall be entitled to 20% of the total amount while the principal sum will be invested in a viable business venture with your advice. most importantly, i will like to buy a personal house where my wife, my two sons and i will reside. upon confirmation of your interest to help us as our foreign partner to claim the crate from the security company on our behalf at any of their commission agent closer to you, i shall furnish you with the details of the movement of the consignment to be scheduled in your favour by the security company prepare an airway bill and tag the consignment in your favour.  your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. kindly treat as urgent and contact me immediately through the above e-mail address {panmentat@rediffmail.com or

heart i offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season. however strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, i humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. i also sincerely seek your confidence, as i make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. first and foremost i wish to introduce myself properly to you. my name is oliveira chuli savimbi, i am a nephew and personal assistant to late jonas malheiro savimbi, leader of unita (national union for the total independence of angola). as led by my instinct, i selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email.  my uncle(mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of angola, led by president dos santos, on friday 22nd february 2002. after his death, mr. antonio dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of unita, due to lack of the charisma my uncle had carried the party with in dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. prominent members like carlos morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including mr.dembo, planned to kill me. the tension and confusion in unita become uncontrollable when mr. dembo died 10days after my uncle's death. as i lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. i now desire a peaceful life, as i am no more interested in conflicts and wars. for this reason, i secretly left angola and came here (holland) to seek!  political asylum. i am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my uncle's money that arose from diamonds sales. this money (us$18.5million), which was already on its way to my uncle's swiss bank account, through the diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in amsterdam, holland in february when the tragic incident of my uncle's death occurred. i then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. i have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. as a matter of fact, the reason i came to holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit.  president dos santos has lobbied the international community to freeze my uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground unita, and has already done this in angola. hence i cannot lodge the funds in my name. also i did not declare the funds to the here. i plan to use this money to safeguard my future. it is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence i want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and i have permission to do business and open an account here.  for your reliable assistance, i will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  i have with me, the certificate of deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. i thank you in advance as i anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. this will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part. http://www.the-idler.com/idler-02/3-16.html sincerely, o.c.savimbi.  for ; sat, 28 dec 2002 10:37:07 -0500 (est) fax: number

seeking your immediate assistance. please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. my name is mr williams daniel of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.   due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country, i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo, we immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping. the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava (one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military personnel from our same tribe, by the new president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president laurent kabila, joseph kabila.  in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. we have sufficient ''contacts'' to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in the europe in your name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. our inability to move this money out of congo all this while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila, immediately after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. thank you and godbless.   best regards mr williams daniel -------------------------------------------------- this email is a free service of phantom email available at

any of the adams' family but to no avail. it is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate jerry adams' next of kin (nok) that the management under the influence of our executive director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest. your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to jerry adams' next of kin (nok)  . your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected.  the money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for

mail may come to you as a surprise, but sincerely this is a  proposal for a business deal that will benefit both of us. i am  contacting you after a frantic search for a person who will be  trustworthy and capable of handling a business of this dimension.  my name is mr. jonathan mokoena, the under-secretary in charge of  intergration at the specialized technical committee of the african  union \(au\), formerly organization of afriacn unity \(oau\). you may be  aware of the transformation of the oau to au, and the mandate to  build a new united africa modelled on the pattern of european union  \(eu\). for this therefore, the various african leaders recently  inaugurated the new patnership for african development \(nepad\). nepad  is to streamline africa towards achieving a common market, defence  force, currency, foreign policy, judiciary etc. for the above, the  various african countries have made whosoever contributions in  hundreds of million dollars. we have equally received grants&aids  from the eu, usa and other international governments and agencies.  these moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars.  as the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and  executing the projects for which they are ment for, i have received  all the money expected. i have also prepared my account which i have  submitted to the au high command, and it has been approved by the au  secratary-general, dr. amara essy. however, in some of the money  received, some of the donor countries and international bodies  remitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged. the au before  now, has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the  monies from them. the money in excess and which i have kept out with  only me having knowledge of it, is in the tune of thirty-five million united states dollars \(us$35,000,000.00\). as it is now, this money belongs to me, as neither the au nor any of the donor countries&international agencies has declared their money missing.  i am therefore contacting you to assist me with the movement and  safe-keeping of this fund. as a public officer in my category, i  cannot openly put this money into any bank here in addis ababa,  ethiopia, the au headquarters where i am now, or in any other part of  africa, as an account holder. this will surely raise eyebrows and  expose me. i have therefore concealed this amount of us$35m in four  metal trunk boxes, and declared them as artefacts belonging to a  foreigner. i deposited the boxes with a security company based in  spain which has an affliate offices in ghana, cot d'ivoire and south africa. these cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction.  this transaction will however be hitch-free. so, i would therefore  want you to be in banjul, the gambia for the clearing and claiming of  this fund. i will furnish you with information&documents on how  you will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes. i have decided to  give to you 40% of the total amount involved.  please i will want you to contact me on this e-mail address or the  alternative: \(joe=5fmokoena=40fastermail.com\).  also, you have to assure me of the secrecy and confidentiality in  this transaction.  thanks in anticipation of your valued co-operation.  mr. jonathan mokoena.   by deadpool.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with esmtp id h0gl0ji18835; thu, 16 jan 2003 16:00:45

a very  confidential transaction, which involves the transfer  of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi-nationals in the oil

been approved and is  now ready to be transfered being that the companies  that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  consequently, my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil  service law)

sum, while 10% shall be set aside for  incidental expenses (internal and external) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in  due course.  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 10 working days subject to your satisfaction of the  above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is risk free.to accord this transaction the legality it  deserves and for mutual security of the funds the  whole approval procedures will officially and legally  processed with your name or the name of any company  you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.  once more i want you to understand that having put in  over twenty five years in the civil service of my  country, i am averse to having my image and career  dented. this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.and i will like you to send me your mail to my praivte box  dr.olusegun.smith@caramail.com i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100% risk free as we have done our home work properly  i quite believe that you will protect our interest by  taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are  still in government service, which we intend to retire from.kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule  to enable us include this transfer in the second batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. thanks and god bless.  dr.olusegun

funds in our names or in the  names of companies that are based in nigeria. i have  therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my  colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas

ministries for 100% security risk free.once more, i want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, i am very careful to have my image and career deemed.

[64.110.146.15] dear sir,   i have a proposal foryou - this however is not mandatory nor will i in any manner compel you to go honour against your will.    i am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the african  leading banks in the west coast). here in this bank  existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which  belong to a syria national who is now late.    when we discovered that there had been no deposits nor  withdrawals from this account for this long period, i  and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a  system investigation and discovered that non of the  family member nor relations of the late syrian is  aware of this account.    this is the story in a nutshell.    now we want an account overseas where we can transfer  this funds. thereafter, we had planned to destroy all  related documents for this account. it is a careful  network and for the past eleven months we have worked  out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.      the amount is not so much at the moment and plus all  the accumulated interest the balance in this account  stands at-us$9,000.000.00 million us dollars.    now our questions are:-    1. can you handle this project?  2. can we give you this trust?  3. what will be your commission?    consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.    finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as  contained herein be accorded the necessary  attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.    we expect your urgent response if you can handle this  project. send a mail for confirmation.      respectfully yours,    mr.daniel

president laurent d. kabila of democratic republic of  congo (drc).  consequent upon the assassination of my husband, i am  in possession of usd 58,000,000 (fifty eight million  us dollars only) being funds earlier earmarked for  special projects.  this fund has since been deposited  in a security company in west african country of togo  where i am residing now with my children. it is now my intention to move the said fund out of  this place (togo) to a safer place for the benefit of  my children and i, for immediate investment.  based on  this that i solicited for your assistance to enable me  take this money out of togo.  however, note that my children and i have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the  offer of assisting us.  also it will be your  responsibility in directing us on a viable business.  it is also my intention to relocate and probably take  a temporarily resident in your country pending when  all the troubles in my country will be resolved. we  advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon  as we arrived.  to conclude this transaction, you will be required to  come to togo to open an account in any bank here in  togo where the security company will deposit the total  sum in your favor. from this bank the money will be  remitted into your original bank in your country.  immediately this done, all of us will depart togo to  your country, where my children and i are expected to  take a temporary resident.  please note that i can not open any bank account with  my name because, my late husband's first  son-joseph-who took over power in our country, don't  want to see me and my children, he claimed that when  our husband was alive, that i was very close to him  than any other of his wives including his (joseph)  mother. he also claimed that because of my closeness  to him that i was able to get things from him more  than others. as a result he has been monitoring me.  infact this one of the main reasons i want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country.  thanking you in advance. yours faithfully,  deborah kabila (mrs.)  n/b: kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for  more explanations. ------------------------------------------------------------ http://game.37.com/   kambili bob 3/5 rides garden close jo'burg, south africa my dear ,  i am bob kambili, bank manager of first national bank south africa pty, south africa,(www.fnb.co.za) and for reasons which will become obvious to you as read on, i obtained your address particulars from an internet address listing. please exercise some patience and read through my message.  you can reach me immediately on my private email address  (henryfnbsa@mail.com) i have a very urgent and confidential business  proposition for you. on june 6th 1998, a gold consultant/contractor with the south african national gold corporation, mr. ahmed youseff mustafa , a national of iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months, value  usd52,000,000.00 (fifty two milion dollas)  in my branch.  on maturity, we sent a routine notification to his  forwarding address but got no reply. after a month,  we sent a reminder and finally, his contract  employers, the south african national gold corporation wrote to inform us that mr. a y mustafa died from an automobile accident; that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the iraqi embassy were fruitless. at first i was surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin in iraq, and inform them about mr. mustafa's deposit of usd52m plus accrued interest. i therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr. mustafa had actively opposed the government of president saddam hussein of iraq, and was consequently driven into exile. being an minning expert,he subsequently obtained a job with the south africa gold coporation,  and settled in south africa. thereafter, he walked into my office to make the aforementioned deposit of usd52m. he did not declare any kin in his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when i asked him he informed me that he wished it so. i accepted his application because banks are conservative and will always honour a customer's wishes, especially high networth customers. no one knows the source of his money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the asgc does indeed preclude such a large amount of money. it can be assumed that he brought his money over from iraq, but that is open to speculation. however, the point is that his employers are not aware of this money , and therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim this money. this money total usd52m ( inclusive of accrued interests) is still sitting in my bank in the dormant account portfolio. no one will ever come forward to claim it now, and according to south african law,  after 5 years, the money will automatically revert  to the federal government treasury if the account  owner is a foreigner, is certified dead , and there is no valid claim. this indeed, is the situation. my proposal therefore is that i am looking for a  foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to  mr. mustafa. it is not necessary to be a blood  relation to mr. mustafa, nor have the same name. it is not also necessary to come from the same country. i have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this means transfer this money total usd52m abroad for us to share.  the method of achieving the objective of  transferring this money abroad in a completely legal and proper way is simple. i intend to use a n attorney ( representing you as beneficiary) to execute a series of affidavits in support of your claim. these will be approved.  the money transfer paperwork itself will include a  certificate of origin so that the receiving bank  does not ask questions or refuse the money as money  laundering. also, the paperwork will include proper  certification that the funds being transferred are  from non criminal sources. in short this will be a  proper and legal money transfer and there is no  risk!.   i will have to process the initial paperwork to  obtain approval from the probate registry ( ministry of justice ) to obtain the letter of administration empowering you as sole trustee/executor to the estate of mr. mustafa.  if you therefore agree to be the official  beneficiary, then please note that you will not be  required to sign any money transfer documents ( my attorney will do all (that), you will not be required to come to south africa.  only the following is required from you:  (1) send to me immediately a bank account ( a bank  account with zero credit balance is ok)  (2) complete name and address of the bank  (3) bank account number  (4) name of account holder/beneficiary  (5) your address, phone and fax  (6) a brief background information on you (cv)  once you send me the requested information as  above, i will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 7 working days the money total usd52m will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. this transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problems. if you agree to assist me by sending me the above requested information, i will give you my complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any further clarifications you may require.  looking forward to your urgent reply.  yours truly  kambili.  __________________________________________________ do you yahoo!? everything you'll ever need on one web

that we have not yet met. the message could be strange but real  if you pay some attention to it. i could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. please accept my sincere apologies.  in bringing this message of goodwill to you, i have to say that i have no intentions of causing you any pains. i am ms. peter savimbi, daughter of the late  rebel leader jonas savimbi of angola who was killed on the 22nd of febuary 2002 . my late father, jonas savimbi was able to deposit a large sum of money in different banks in europe and the movement of his family members (including me) is restricted. we are forbidden  to either travel abroad or out of our localities. presently, the sum of  us$8,500,000.00 eight million, five hundred thousand dollars my father transferred to  netherlands is safe and is with a security  firm. i am therefore soliciting your help to have this money transferred into your account before my  government get wind of this fund. you may know that my father was a rebel leader in angola before his death and my reason for doing this is because it will  be difficult for the angolan government to trace my father's money  to an individual's account, especially when such an individual has no  relationship with my father thereby keeping that money for my family use.  at present the money as i said is kept in a security company in the netherland. i am currently and temporarily living in angola  with my husband. my brother has a refugee status in the netherlands. moreover, the political climate in angola at the moment is so sensitive and unstable so it will be better we do this transaction now. with this password and information i will send  you, and the change of ownership that i will send to the security  firm, you will be able to represent us in the netherlands to claim this  consignment from the security firm. when you are ready, i will give  you the information needed before you can get access to the fund, you will  then proceed to netherlands where you will sign the final release documents of the us$8,500,000.00 eight, million, five hundred thousand dollars. i will give you further details when i get your response to this letter assuring us that you will be able to represent us in the netherlands andthat will make this transaction confidential. it is very important that you give me your phone and

my department we discovered an abandoned sum of  us$12.500,000.00 (tweleve. five million usd only) in an  account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who  died along with his entire family in november 1999 in a  plane crash. since we got information about his death, we have been  expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money  because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it  as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in  our banking guidelines. unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin  or relations died along with him at the plane crash leaving  nobody behind for the claim. it is therefore upon this discovery that i and one of the  officials in the department now decided to make business  with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or  relations of the deceased for safety and subsequent  disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't  want this money to go disbursement account as unclaimed  bill. the banking law and guidelines here stipulated that if such  money remained unclaimed after four years the money will be  transferred into federal government account as unclaimed  fund. the request of a foreigner as next of kin in this  business is occasioned by the fact that the customers was a  foreigner and an ivorien cannot stand as next of kin to a  foreigner. we agree that 15% of this money will be for you as foreign  partner and 5% for expenses incurred during the course of  remittance. thereafter to the percentages indicated. therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the fund to  you as arranged. you must apply first to the bank as a  relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your  bank account number and location where in the money will be  remitted . upon receipt of your reply i will send to you  the text of the application. as soon as you receive this  letter, you should contact me immediately and indicate your  direct and confidential telephone/fax numbers for the  effective communication required. trusting to hear from you immediately on telephone number  0022507822694. yours faithfully, f. lamine director, foreign operations

myself. your particulars were given to me by a member of the nigerian export promotion council \(nepc\) who was at the federal government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. i have decided to seek a confidential cooperation with you in the execution of the deal described here for the benefit of all parties involved and hope that you will keep it as top secret because of the nature of the business and the personalities involved. within the ministry of power and steel where i work as a director project implementation and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totalling $45,000 000:00m usd \(forty five million united state dollars\) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a trusted foreign firm or individual who will receive the said fund on our behalf into any account provided to receive such funds. we are handicapped in this deal because the civil service code of conduct does not allow public servants like us to operate offshore account, hence your importance in the whole transaction. the said amount which we have gotten approval to remit by telegraphic transfer \(t.t.\) to foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through my ministry for the transfer of right and privileges to you. since the present new civilian government of my country is determined to pay every foreign contractor all debts owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign government and non-government financial agencies, we have decided to include our bill for approvals with the cooperation of some officials from all the government ministry which will be involved in the payment process. we are seeking your assistance in providing a vital account into which we can remit this money by acting as our main partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor. this we can do by swapping of account and changing of beneficiary and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the payment and approvals to be secured on behalf of you.  i have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the total sum, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. the business is 100% safe on your part, but you have to keep it confidential. do not inform your banker yet unless instructed by us. also, your area of specialization is not a hiderance to the successful execution of this transaction. i have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. please send reply to me to indicate your willingness in assisting us so that i will direct you on what next to do.include your direct telephone and fax numbers if you are responding. thanks for your anticipated assistance. yours sincerely, patrick  mohammed. dear,  naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, i am mr. lawrence abba, a zimbabwean farmer.  i am contacting you as the need to for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country zimbabwe, does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not insured, just as reported by international media.  i got your contacts through personal research and out of desperation i decided to reach you through this medium. i will give you more information as regards to this as soon as you reply and i repose great confidence in you hence my approach due to security network place on us and i hope you will not let me out to security personal. this problem started when the zimbabwean government under the leadership of president robert mugabe announced a degree on may 31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white-owned farms.  so far, more than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of the farmers. consequently, most of my colleagues and our properties were seized again putting us to total confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the administration of president mugabe in my country and we where subjected to psychological torture by the security agents in the country. some of my friends are still under detention, although arrangements are being made for their release, now i have no confidence with anybody within my country. during these periods, as reported by some international media including the cnn, so many white farmers were killed, the government is not stopping at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. having lived in this country zimbabwe for so many years, i have no other country to go to, nor can i trace any of my distant relatives. therefore, i decided to contact you, for your assistance, so that i can establish a company in your country and relocate there. also, i must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that i am a foreigner. for this purpose, i have put in a security deposit all monies from the sale of my farm and farming equipments \(including tractors etc\) which amounted to us$6.5million, i had to move the money out of the country through a very secret arranged channel in a very unconventional method by my friend an official at the "security minting  & printing company" of my country.  presently, the money is in an oversea country, under the custody of a private security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.   i will upon receiving your consent prepare every document to enable you receive this money on my behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country so that we can both make further arrangements with regards to establishing the company. as a partner you will be entitled to 20% stake in whichever company that you both decide to establish when i arrive your country. i am waiting urgently for your response and please treat with utmost confidentiality. best regards  lawrence abba. message-id:  x-originating-ip: 172.21.1.219 hello, i am mr.bill james an

account the total sum of sixty five million united states dollars =5b$65million=5d  since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. unfortunately from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim. the banking and financial law of union bank of nigeria plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of four years \(4\) it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. on this discovery sir, i and a colleague of mine now decided do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to ali b. ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. i will soon proceed for my retirement in the middle of  this year, and i personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. that is why i wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before i proceed on my retirement from the banking services by june 15th 2003. the need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer mr. ali ashraf was a foreigner and a nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. we have agreed that 15% of the fund would be for you as foreign partner=3b thereafter my colleague and i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. to enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased, indicating your

general sani abacha who died on the 8th of june 1998 while on active duty. i am contacting you in view of the fact we will be of great assistance to each other, likewise developing a cordial business relationship. i currently have within my reach the sum of fifty-five million united states dollars \($55,000,000,00\) cash, which i intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. this money came as a result of a pay-back contract deal between my late husband and a russian firm in our country's multi-billion dollar ajaokuta steel plant. the russian partners returned my husband's share of us$55,000,000.00 u.s.d after his death, and lodged it in my late husband's security company of which i am a director right now, the new civilian government has intensified their probe on my late husband's financial resources and have frozen our accounts. in view of these facts, i acted fast to withdraw the us$55,000,000.00 u.s.d from the company's vault and deposited it in a privately owned security safe in my village. i have since declared the security company bankrupt. no record whatsoever exists concerning the money traceable by the government because, there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the russians. due to the current situation in the country concerning the government's attitude towards my husband, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within=3b thus upon consent, i shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, i propose a commission of 10% \(ten percent\) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contact. i must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt

tutu  content-disposition: inline mime-version: 1.0 x-originating-ip: [212.100.72.142] dear sir,  i am sam aluko, former special adviser on petroleum matters  to the late  head of state of government of nigeria gen. sani abacha.  because of my  strategic position in the former government and also being a  close confidant  of the late head of state, i was able to acquire personally the  sum of  $50,000,000.00 usd ( fifty million united states dollars only)  presently  lodged in a security deposit in europe. i made this money  largely through  "consultancy fee" and good faith fees" paid by foreign oil  companies prior  to allocation of deep water oil blocs and other  lifting/prospecting right.  nigeria is the 6th largest producer/exporter of crude oil in  the world.  as you are probably aware of the fact that nigeria is prone to  military coups and the resultant political/economic instability  has fueled  hyper inflation, amongst other problems. i have therefore  resolved to  invest my money abroad, preferable in real estate properties  and importation  of goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on  investment.  however the, present civilian administration of president  olusegun obasanjo  has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the  cabinet of the  past military government. this is as a result of the panel of  inquiry  slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the  late former  head of state. this means that i cannot travel out now till the  panel  conclude its investigations which only god knows when that  would be.  straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present  two major  problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as  60% of this  money will go up in taxes, levies, penalties etc. as a result  of government  deliberate restrictions on flight of capital abroad. however  arrangement  have been put in place for you to receive this money from a  trust worthy  security deposit company in europe. as soon as you indicate  your interest.  i will send to you the security code number, certificate of  deposit number  and airway bill number of the deposit that will serve as the  onus of proof  to enable you claim the money, which is tagged, diplomatic  luggage.  all i now need is an honest partner who can receive the money  on my behalf  and help me to invest as aforementioned.  there is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as  the money will  be delivered to you in united states dollars bills.  if you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by  email  immediately your preferred contact address where you can be  reached at any  time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in  a bank  account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the  investment of the  funds. for your help and assistance in this deal, you will be  entitled to  25% of this money in cash or equity if you wish to join the  proposed  company.  finally you are to please urgently send to me through the  required contact address that include your telephone and fax  number), so  that i can instruct the west side deposit company to go ahead  with the  transfer to you  best regards,  sam aluko ------------------------------------------------------------ http://game.37.com/  ; mon, 10 feb 2003 10:37:08 -0500 (est) attn: re urgent

security  reasons,as my narration below will explain. but before i continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has been calculated at  15% of the total sum of usd$55m, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.    my father as a real african traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my  father, my step brother joseph, who is the current president of my country, is  the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.    already president joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and private property, which my father left behind for the whole family.  now my mother and i are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late  father's wealth. our situation is seriously critical that we need your  assistance to help us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.    let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that shows no  direct trace or linkage with us \(kabila family\). at present the money is in cash and is secured in a financial institution

rtd general buba s.g.bamiyi, who was the estwhile minister of the federal capital territory abuja in thelate general sani abachas regime of 1993-1998.i am contacting you in a benevolent spirit=3b utmost confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $25m that is presently putting my entire family into great disarray.  you may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, i got your contact from a business site on the internet and following the information i gathered about you, i was convinced that you could be of assistance to me. so,i decided to contact you at once due to the urgency required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the country. during the time my father was in the government with the late general sani abacha as the head of state,they were both involved in several deals that yielded billions of dollars. the prominent amongst the deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation of arms and ammunitions to boost the nigerian defense, funds set to embark on an oversea ampaign to counter the united states action to put a stop to the self succession bid of the abacha government to retain power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing nigerian petroleum refineries and the national electric power authority which supplies electricity to the entire nation. if you are conversant with world news, you would understand better. during this period my father was able to make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts. the then head of state general sani abacha transferred his share of the money through a lebanese businessman, chagoury and a jewish businessman, mark rissar to bank accounts overseas. unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive governments and most of the abacha=3fs loots were traced and repatriated fromthe various accounts to the federal government treasury. out of the money my father made, he left the sum of n50 million \(fifty million naira\) in the cbn escrow account for further transfer into a foreign account and a sum of $25m \(twenty-five million dollars\) was kept in a private security firm here in nigeria. through the confessions made by the abacha=3fs family, the n50 million was recovered by the investigating agency from the cbn escrow account. but were unable to discover the $25m, which he kept in the vaults. the reason is because no names were used to lodge in the funds.instead, he used personal identification numbers \(pin\) and declared the contents as bearer bonds and treasury bills. also the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments. note thati have these information in my custody. right now, my father has been arrested and detained for interrogation. as the eldest son of my father, i believe that i owe the entire family an obligation to ensure that the $25m is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes. with the present situation, i cannot do it all by myself.  it is based on this that i am making this contact with you. i have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best wayto create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. is rest assured that the modalities i have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the successful transfer of the funds. so, you will be absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable. if you are capable and willing to assist,contact me at once via email for more details. believe me, there is no one else we can trust gain.all my fathers friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my father. as it is said, "it is at the time of problems that you know your true friends". so long as you keep everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. for your assistance, i am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable business you may suggest. please, i need your assistance to make this happen and please=3b do not undermine it because it will also be asource of up liftment to you also. you have absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead,you have so much to gain. awaiting your urgent and positive response. best regards  mr.yaro

                 business proposal. please permit me to introduce myself.  i am the financial director of union bank of nigeria plc. union bank is one of the biggest commercial banks in nigeria. the board of directors of the bank met on the 13th of november over a matter that requires your co-operation and assistance. in 1996, one of our esteemed customers, mr. adil bantam, an indonesian citizen who died in a plane crash along with members of his family. the  adc plane crashed into the atlantic ocean off the coast of lagos, killing all the passengers and crew. before the death of mr. adil bantam, he  was the managing director of deep-blue oil servicing company. his company has both current and savings accounts with our bank. at the time of his death, he had us$26.6million in both accounts.when our bank was  notified of his death, we made efforts to contact his immediate next of kin through his embassy in victoria island, lagos. the embassy later wrote to us informing us that all attempt on their part to contact any of  his relatives was not successful. it was at this point we contacted the government of nigeria through the ministry of finance informing them about this problem. the government wrote to us back directing our bank to  place mr. adil bantam funds in a suspense account pending when any of his relatives shows up to claim the money. this was in 1996. however, we received instructions from the nigerian government giving us till the end of december  2002 to disburse this fund to the next of kin of mr. adil bantam, or the money will be used to buy arms to support the civil wars in sierra leone and angola. it was as a result of these directives from government that made the board of directors of our bank  to meet. after careful considerations of the intention of government to use the money to support war instead of eradicating disease and poverty, the board then mandated me to contact you for assistance to receive  this money as the next of kin to mr. adil bantam. what we want to do is to present you or your company as the next of kin to mr. adil bantam which will entitle you to receive this money on his  behalf. it will not be difficult to establish the relationship. you could be a relative to his later wife or his uncle from his mother's side.  as soon as you confirm your willingness to assist, you shall be provided with all information relating to the late mr.adil bantam, as contained in our file. you do not have to worry about this proposal, as the  board of union bank is 100% behind this proposal. when we have successfully remitted the fund in your account, you shall assist us invest our  shares into profitable business in your country for 2years. your interest will be 30% of the total sum after the successful completion of this  transaction.sir, should you be willing to assist in this matter,kindly get back to me on my telephone number +234-803-3044193 stating your telephone and fax numbers along with your bank detail were the money will be transfer to and any question you may need  to ask about this transaction. we want to assure you of a hitch free transaction, as your involvement will not expose you to any risks now or after the successful completion of the transaction. we thank you once more while we look forward to your urgent response to this letter. best regards, mr.sadik

abacha wife to the late nigerian head of state,  general sani abacha who died on the 8th of june 1998 while on active duty.  i am contacting you in view of the fact we will be of great assistance  to each other, likewise developing a cordial business relationship.  i currently have within my reach the sum of fifty-five million united states  dollars \($55,000,000,00\) cash, which i intend to use for investment purposes  specifically in your country. this money came as a result of a pay-back  contract deal between my late husband and a russian firm in our country's  multi-billion dollar ajaokuta steel plant. the russian partners returned  my husband's share of us$55,000,000.00 u.s.d after his death, and lodged  it in my late husband's security company of which i am a director right now,  the new civilian government has intensified their probe on my late husband's  financial resources and have frozen our accounts. in view of these facts,  i acted fast to withdraw the us$55,000,000.00 u.s.d from the company's  vault and deposited it in a privately owned security safe in my village.  i have since declared the security company bankrupt.  no record whatsoever exists concerning the money traceable by the  government because, there is no documentation showing that we received  the money from the russians. due to the current situation in the country  concerning the government's attitude towards my husband, it has become  quite impossible for me to make use of this money within=3b thus upon consent,  i shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail  about this transaction. bearing in mind that your assistance is needed  to transfer this fund, i propose a commission of 10% \(ten percent\)  of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.  your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contact.  i must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost  indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential,  whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. please send your phone and fax nos where i can reach you day or night as the need arises.  best regards,

to know of you in my search for  a reliable and reputable person to handle a very  confidential transaction, which involves the transfer  of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in  favour of n.n.p.c. the original value of these  contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum  of usd$25,000,000.00 \(twenty five million united state dollars\). this amount has now been approved and is  now ready to be transfered being that the companies  that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  consequently, my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau \(civil  service law\) from operating and&or opening foreign  accounts in our names. needless to say, the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in  return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the  transfered sum, while 10% shall be set aside for  incidental expenses \(internal and external\) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in  due course.  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 10 working days subject to your satisfaction of the  above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is risk free.to accord this

dented. this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.and i will like you to send me your mail to my praivte box  dr.olusegun.smith=40caramail.com i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100% risk free as we have done our home work properly  i quite believe that you will protect our interest by  taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are  still in government service, which we intend to retire from.kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule  to enable us include this transfer in the second batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. thanks and god bless.  dr.olusegun smith nb:  but if you know you are interested let me know. list  your phone & fax numbers so we may  communicate with you. this is important as we would  have to talk about the modalities of the transaction.  waiting to hear from you.  this is a multi-part message in mime format --6afff921-4545-4b70-8138-4eebeab7d224 dr. bernard makelele  pretoria, south africa.    sir,    on behalf of my colleagues and i, i write this letter with great pleasure.  your information were given to me by a member of the south african export  promotion council (saepc) who was with the black  economic empowerment commission (government) delegation on a trip to the  united states during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign  investors. i have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in  execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.    within the department of mining resources where i work as the director of  project implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have  in our possession, an overdue payment in us funds.    the said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed  on behalf of my ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the  officials  over-invoiced to the amount of us$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million five  hundred thousand united states dollars). though the actual contract cost has  been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.    the government of the republic of south africa believe that private  investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the  real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has  continued to encourage  investment in the key growth-oriented sector of mining with sincere  determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to  continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation  with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. as a result  we included our bills for approvals with the  co-operation of some officials at the department of finance and the reserve  bank of south africa (rbsa).  we are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds,  since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. the changing of  beneficiary\'s information/details and other forms of  documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and  its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.  i have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you  be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will  be 20% while my colleagues and i shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10%  shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses  so incurred.  it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the  nature described here. the assumption is that your company won the major  contract and subcontracted it to other companies.  more often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win  major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.    this business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost  confidentiality. also your specialization is not a hindrance to the  successful  execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. i have reposed my  confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.  kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this  proposal.    regards,    dr. benard makelele.     --6afff921-4545-4b70-8138-4eebeab7d224-- message-id:  in-reply-to:  attn: my dear,  i know this proposal letter might be a pleasant suprise to you as we don't know our selves before but be sured it is

way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment and we also want to add here that if accepted by you,you will serve as the original beneficiary of the money. we feel confident therefore,to introduce this offer to you. for your participation and assistance regarding this transfer,we have decided to give you 15 percent of the total amount and 5 percent mapped out

transfer this money from dakar senegal to your country resident account or any account of your interest. on commencement of this transaction i want to let you understand that the future of myself and

messaging program (imp) 2.3.7-cvs dr. williams banigo federal secretariat, lagos, nigeria email:  banigo@caramail.com              urgent   &   confidential best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my  proposal as contained in this letter.before going into details of my proposal to you,  i must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost confidentiality, as this is required for  its success. my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of nigeria's  contracts review panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are  presently floating in the accounts of the central bank of nigeria.in order to  commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account the said floating funds. we are determined to conclude the  transfer before the end of this financial quarter. the source of the funds are as follows: during the last military regime, government  officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to contractors.the  present civilian government set up the contract review panel, which has the  mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree  setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who  are being owed outstanding amounts. my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are  presently floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for disbursement and would  like to divert some of it for our own purposes. however, by virtue of our positions  as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our  names or in the names of companies that are based in nigeria. i have therefore  been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a  reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of  u.s.$16,500,000.00(sixteen million,five hundred  thousand u.s. dollars). that is  why i am writing you this letter. we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the account owner (you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the  actualisation of this project. we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock  markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them.  please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.we intend to effect  the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information: your name, company's name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your  banking information. the above information will enable us write letters of claim  andjob description respectively. this way, we will use your company's name to  apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company. we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your  utmost confidentiality in this transaction. please acknowledge the receipt of this  letter and, i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you. best regards, dr. williams banigo pls. reply to : banigo@caramail.com --===_lenthe_000_2caknehnaccgvg name:dr. abdull rasaq dr..abdull.rasaq=40caramail.com  request

multi-nationals in the oil industry in  favour of n.n.p.c. the original value of these  contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum  of usd$25,000,000.00 \(twenty five million united state dollars\). this amount has now been approved and is  now ready to be transfered being that the companies  that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned.  consequently, my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau \(civil  service law\) from operating and&or opening foreign  accounts in our names. needless to say, the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in  return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the  transfered sum, while 10% shall be set aside for  incidental expenses \(internal and external\) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in  due course.  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 10 working days subject to your satisfaction of the  above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is risk free.to accord this transaction the legality it  deserves and for mutual security of the funds the  whole approval procedures will officially and legally  processed with your name or the name of any company  you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.  once more i want you to understand that having put in  over twenty five years in the civil service of my  country, i am averse to having my image and career  dented. this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.and i will like you to send me your mail to my praivte box  dr..abdull.rasaq=40caramail.com =3cmailto:dr..abdull.rasaq=40caramail.com=3e i want to assure you

ikoyi,lagos.  internet fax:1 309 216 0222                please i request for your genuine assistance i want to first solicit your confidence in this transaction. this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. we shall be counting on your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence.  we are top officials of the federal government contract review panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in nigeria. in order to commence this business we solicit our assistance to enable us receive the said trapped funds abroad.  the source of this fund is as follows : during the regime of our late head of state, gen. sani abacha,the government officials set up companies  and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries. the new civilian government set up a contract review panel (c.r.p) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the bank.  however, due to our position as civil servants and members of this panel,we cannot acquire this money in our names. i have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of  the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account the sum of us$15,600,000.00(fifteen million six hundred thousand united states dollars) will be paid by telegraphic transfer. hence we are writing you this letter.  we have agreed to share the money thus:  70% for us (the officials) 20% for the foreign partner (you)  10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.  it is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business.please note that this transaction is 100% safe in all it's ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your account in latest ten (10) banking days from the date of reciept of the following information by email: a suitable name and bank account into which the funds can be paid. your confidential telephone and fax numbers for essay communication.  the above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. this way we will use your company's name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name/company name.we  are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your confidentiality in this transaction.  for security reasons and in order to move forward quickly,please respond to me by tel:234 1 776 0870,internet fax:1 309 216 0222,so i can bring you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more information as to the succcessful conclusion of this project. the best response however,would be by telephone, so we can discuss fully all issues needed to complete this venture in good time,and successfully. thank you and god bless.  yours faithfully dr. israel junaid internet fax:1 309 216

assistant to alhaji rewani lukeman, the  presidential adviser on petroleum matters. my message to you is based  on some money that floated into the government treasury due to the  recent boom in the international oil market. the federal government of nigeria budgeted us$18.00 per barrel in last  year budget, but the price was changed in the international oil market  where a barrel was sold between us$28-us$35.00.  we recorded excess gain, and all these could not be accounted for,  hence some executive members in the petroleum ministry decided to take away  the sum of us$18,532,700.00, \(eighteen million five hundred and thirty  two thousand seven hundred united states dollars\) to an offshore  account of a foreign national or company. please we are not contacting you because we cannot do this business on  our own successfully, but because we are not allowed to operate foreign  accounts as civil servants, that is why we are looking for a foreigner  we can use and knowing fully well that as a white man, the movement of  the fund will raise no doubt that is why we have decided to contact  you. if you are interested to assist us, please let me have your personal  telephone, fax and email address, so that i can furnish you with further  details on the modalities of the transfer of the fund into your bank  account. please you are advised to keep this matter to your self, as we  do not want it to be exposed in order not to jeopardize our chances of  succeeding. let it be known to you that this transaction is hundred  percent risks free and your security has been well taken care off. if you  are interested in this transaction, call me immediately through my private telephone number 234-1-776 4163 or send me a email  to ke=5filoka1965=40themail.comfor further clarifications. best regards.   mr. kenneth iloka tel:234-1-776 4163 fax to 234-1-759 4377  email: ke=5filoka1965=40themail.com  for ; sun, 2 mar 2003 17:52:31 -0500 (est) x-priority: 3 mime-version: 1.0 universal trust bank.website:www.utbplc.com dear friend, this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. the message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it.  i could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. please accept my sincere apologies. in writing you this message, i have to say that  i have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment.   i am mr. charles nwodo manager with universal trust bank  plc. of nigeria, island branch. i managed to get your contact details through the internet myself.  time is of the importance and i am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. a british oil consultant/contractor with the nigerian  national petroleum corporation, mr. claude brian best made a numbered time (fixed) deposit on january 6, 1999, valued at us$2,500,000.00 (two million five  hundred thousand us dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.   after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. claude brian best died  in an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.  i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. claude brian best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank  deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum of us$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to nigerian law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government  if nobody applies to claim the fund. consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr. claude brian best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into  the hands of some corrupt government officials.  this is simple, i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary  documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  we shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the  necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  a bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer  of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below; charlesnwodo@dr.com.  upon your response, i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your  country. awaiting your urgent reply via my email address .thanks and regards.  mr. charles nwodo. good day, with warm heart i offer my friendship, and greetings, and i hope this mail meets you in good time. however strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, i humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. i duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as i make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. first and foremost i wish to introduce myself properly to you. my name is oliveira chuli savimbi, i am a nephew and personal assistant to late jonas malheiro savimbi, leader of unita (national union for the total independence of angola). as led by my instinct, i selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. i also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  my uncle (mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of angola, led by president dos santos, on friday 22nd february 2002. after his death, mr. antonio dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of unita, due to the lack of charisma my uncle had carried the party with in dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. prominent members like carlos morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including mr.dembo, planned to kill me. the tension and confusion in unita become uncontrollable when mr. dembo died 10days after my uncle's death. as i already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. i then desired a peaceful life, as i no more had interest in conflicts and wars. for this reason, i secretly left angola and came here (holla! nd) to seek for political asylum. i am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my uncle's money that arose from diamonds sales. this money (us$18.5million), which was already on its way to my uncle's swiss bank account, through the diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in amsterdam, holland in february last year when the tragic incident of my uncle's death occurred. i then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. i have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. as a matter of fact, the reason i came to holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the security company here in amsterdam.  president jose eduardo dos santos has lobbied the international community to freeze my uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground unita, and has already done this in angola. hence i cannot lodge the funds in my name. also i did not declare the funds to the government here. i plan to use this money to safeguard my future. it is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence i want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and i have permission to do business and open an account here.  for your reliable assistance, i will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  i have with me, the certificate of deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. i thank you in advance as i anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. this will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

4 mar 2003 13:46:16 -0500 (est) greetings, my friend, permit me to introduce first myself then the purpose of this letter. i am mr papa bello, bank manager of orient bank of nigeria, lagos branch. i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you and it is carefully explained for your understanding as follows. on june 6 1997, an american oil consultant&contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation, mr. barry kelly made a numbered time account \(fixed\) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at us$25,000,000.00 \(twenty-five million united states dollars\) in my branch. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. barry kelly has since died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out that he did not leave a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. barry kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. this sum of us$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. no one will come forward to claim it. according to the nigerian law, at the expiration of 5 \(five\) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the funds. consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr. barry kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some undeserving and corrupt officials. this is simple, i will like you to provide me immediately with the following=3b your full names, date and place of birth and complete address with confidential telephone and fax numbers so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. we shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the will and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate&administration in your favor for the transfer. a bank account in any part of the world, which you would provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary&next of kin. the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, upon your response, i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. awaiting your urgent reply via e-mail. thanks and regards, mr papa bello.  by deadpool.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with esmtp id

permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. my name is mr williams daniel of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.   due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country, i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million, five hundred thousand united states dollars only (us$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo, we immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping. the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. rasheidi karesava (one of the aides to laurent kabila) a tribesman, and some other military personnel from our same tribe, by the new president of the democratic republic of congo, the son of late president laurent kabila, joseph kabila.  in view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. we have sufficient ''contacts'' to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in the europe in your name. this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. our inability to move this money out of congo all this while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president kabila, immediately after his son took office. though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while i await your prompt response. thank you and godbless.   best regards mr williams

proposal with full financial benefit for both of us. before i go into further details please be informed that i am writing without any other person\(s\) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction. therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through. i have the sum of usd55million from a secret sale of diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body guard \(rashid\) on january 16th 2001, which i will like you to receive on my behalf due to security reasons,as my narration below will explain. but before i continue b e well informed that your share in this transaction has been calculated at 15% of the total sum of usd$55m, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me. my father as a real african traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, my step brother joseph, who is the current president of my country, is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal. already president joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and private property, which my father left behind for the whole family. now my mother and i are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late father's wealth. our situation is seriously critical that we need your assistance to help us receive these funds overseas for proper investment. let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pa ttern that shows no direct trace or linkage with us \(kabi! la family\). at present the money is in cash and is secured in a financial institution company as consignment. the consignment will be released within seven \(7\) days of my being in receipt of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons. i am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any question\(s\), do not hesitate to contact me.my alternative email is

sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the security company here in amsterdam.  president jose eduardo dos santos has lobbied the international community to freeze my uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground unita, and has already done this in angola. hence i cannot lodge the funds in my name. also i did not declare the funds to the government here. i plan to use this money to safeguard my future. it is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence i want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and i have permission to do business and open an account here.  for your reliable assistance, i will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.  i have with me, the certificate of deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. i thank you in advance as i anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. this will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part. http://www.the-idler.com/idler-02/3-16.html http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm sincerely, o.c.savimbi.  by perfectworld.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with smtp id

daniel kalu manager,bills and exchange. telephone 234-8033008245 attn , request for business partnership  i am the manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance  department of this bank. iam writing you following the impressive  information about you through one of my friends who worked with  the nigerian chamber of comerce before his transfer to the nigerian trade mission in hong kong. he assured me of your capability and reliability  to champion a business of great magnitude like this one,although  i did not tell him the nature of this business because of the confidentiality it requires. in my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of usd25million(twenty  five million united states dollars only) in a domiciliary account  that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died in a ghastly plane crash in january ! 2000 aboard kenya airways along with his entire family. since we got the information about his death, we have expected his  next- of- kin to come over and claim the money because we cannot  release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. unfortunately we  learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relations died along  with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  it is upon this discovery therefore, that i and one key officials  in my department now decided to make business with you and release  the money to you as the next of kin or relation of the deceased  for safe-keeping and subsequent disbursement with you since nobody  is coming for it and we do not want this money to be recycled into  the bank's bounded account as an unclaimed fund. the request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is  occasioned by the fac! t that the customer was a foreigner and a nigeria  cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. we have agreed that  25% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, thereafter  my colleague and i will visit your country for the disbursement  according to the agreed percentages. personally, i would want you to advise me on the best area of investment  because i am considering to invest the greater proportion of my share in your country. therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the fund via our correspondent  finance house in aborad to you as arranged, you should first apply  to the bank as the next of kin or business partner of the deceased indicating your account details wherein the money will  be remited. upon receipt of your reply mail, i shall send to you  the text of the application which you will be required to sumit to the bank for the bank's procedural authentication and immediate remittance of  the money to the ! account you are going to nominate. as soon as you receive this mail, do contact me at once through  my email mustafabello@operamail.com, at once or better still you call me telephone 234-8033008245 on my above telephone number for more clarification.  and i would also like you to indicate your private and confidential  telephone, fax,cellular and e-mail for the effective communication required. *be informed that all necessary arrangements towards the successful  transfer of the fund via our correspondent finance house in aborad  have been concluded and it is 100% risk free.  trusting to hear from you immediately. yours faithfully, mr.daniel

tunda@zapo.net  urgent business partnership  attention:president/c.e.o       dear sir, my name is mr tunda useni the eldest son of rtd general  jeremaiah. j. t. useni who was the est. while minister of the federal  capital territory abuja in the late general sani abacha\\\'s regime of  1993-  1998. i am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and  trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60m that is  presently putting my entire family into great disarray. you may be quite  surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, i got your  contact from a business site on the internet and following the  information i gathered about you, i was convinced that you could be of  assistance to me. so, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency  required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the  country. during the time my father was in the government with the late  general sani abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in  several deals that yielded billions of dollars. the prominent amongst the  deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation  of arms and ammunitions to boost the nigerian defense, funds set to  embark on an oversea campaign to counter the united states action to put  a stop to the self succession bid of the abacha\\\\\\\'s government to  retain  power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing nigerian petroleum  refineries and the national electric power authority which supplies  electricity to the entire nation. if you are conversant with world news,  you would understand better. during this period my father was able to  make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.  the then head of state general sani abacha transferred his share of the  money through a lebanese businessman, chagoury and a jewish businessman,  mark rissar to bank accounts overseas. unfortunately, all the secrets  were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive  governments and most of the abacha\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and  repatriated  from the various accounts to the federal government treasury. out of the  money my father made, he left the sum of n50 million (fifty million  naira) in the cbn escrow account for further transfer into a foreign  account and a sum of $60m (sixty million dollars) was kept in a private  security firm here in nigeria. through the confessions made by the  abacha\\\'s family, the n50 million was recovered by the investigating  agency from the cbn escrow account. but were unable to discover the $60m,  which he kept in the vaults. the reason is because no names were used to  lodge in the funds. instead, he used personal identification numbers  (pin) and declared the contents as bearer bonds and treasury bills. also  the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.  note that i have these information in my custody. right now, my father  has been arrested and detained for interrogation. as the eldest son of my  father, i believe that i owe the entire family an obligation to ensure  that the $60m is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.  with the present situation, i cannot do it all by myself. it is based on  this that i am making this contact with you. i have done a thorough  homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to  the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. is rest assured that the  modalities i have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our  safety and the successful transfer of the funds. so, you will be  absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.  if you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email  for more details. believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.  all my fathers\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the  pretence of trying to help my father. as it is said, \\\"it is at the time  of problems that you know your true friends\\\". so long as you keep  everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. for your  assistance, i am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds  after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable  business you may suggest. please, i need your assistance to make this  happen and please; do not

success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter.before going into details  of my proposal to you, i must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of nigeria's contracts review panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the central bank of nigeria.in order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating funds. we are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this financial quarter. the source of the funds are as follows: during the last military regime, government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to  contractors.the present civilian government set up the contract review panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which  are presently floating in the central bank of nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. however, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in nigeria. i have therefore been mandated, as a  matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of u.s.$16,500,000.00(sixteen million,five hundred  thousand u.s. dollars). that is why i am writing you this letter. we have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the account owner (you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the actualisation of this project. we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.we intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information: your name, company's name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your banking information. the above information will enable us write letters of claim andjob description respectively. this way, we will use your company's name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company. we are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. please acknowledge the receipt of this letter and, i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when i hear from you. best regards, dr. williams banigo check out http://www.abercrombie.com/aftv engr. zulu makaleni pretoria, south africa.  sir,  on behalf of my colleagues and i, i write this  letter with great pleasure. your information were  given to me by a member of the south african export  promotion council \(saepc\) who was with the black  economic empowerment commission \(government\)  delegation on a trip to the united states during a  bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign  investors. i have decided to seek a confidential  co-operation with you in execution of a business  transaction hereunder for the benefit of all  parties.  within the department of mining resources where i  work as the director of project implementation, with  co-operation of two other top officials, we have in  our possession, an overdue payment in us funds.  the said funds represent certain percentage of the  contract value executed on behalf of my ministry by  a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials  over-invoiced to the amount of us$14,300,000.00  \(fourteen  million, three hundred thousand united  states dollars\). though the actual contract cost has  been paid to the original contractor, leaving the  excess balance unclaimed.  the government of the republic of south africa  believe that private investment in general, and  foreign direct investment in particular, are the  real engines for sustainable economic development,  for which reason it has continued to encourage  investment in the key growth-oriented sector of  mining with sincere determination to pay foreign  contractors all debts owed to them, so as to  continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually  beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and  non-governmental financial agencies. as a result we  included our bills for approvals with the  co-operation of some officials at the department of  finance and the reserve bank of south africa \(rbsa\).  we are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary  of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to  operate a foreign account. the changing of  beneficiary's information&details and other forms of  documentation upon application for claim to reflect  the contract money and its approvals will be secured   on behalf of your company or your good self.  i have the authority of my colleagues involved to  propose that, should you be willing to assist us in  this transaction your share as compensation will be  30% while my colleagues and i shall receive 60%, and  the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all  expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so  incurred.  it does not matter whether or not your company does  contract projects of the nature described here. the  assumption is that your company won the major  contract and subcontracted it to other companies.  more often than not, big trading companies and firms  of unrelated fields win major contracts, and  subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.  this business itself is 100% safe, provided you  treat it with utmost confidentiality. also your  pecialization is not a hindrance to the successful  execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. i  have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you  will not disappoint us.  kindly notify me by email for further details, upon  your acceptance of this proposal.  regards,  engr. zulu makaleni. message-id:  --0-389739429-1049080945=:20979 no 53.mendas close, community 12, tema, accra-ghana. pis contact me:(luza20032002@yahoo.com)  dear sir :  with

former military ruler of \( cote d' ivoire&ivory   coast,\) who was killed on 19&9&2002 with some of his loyalist officers during a cross fire battle between them and government troops in his attempt to seize power through coup de eta in abidjan on 19&9&2002 .   in brief, i have the sum of twenty million seven hundred thousand united states dollars\(us$20,700,000\)only which i want to move out of here with most desperation. this money was deposited by my late father in a security company for the purpose of using it to fine tune his administration in the invent that he succeed in the fail coup attempt. while i was also made the sole beneficiary and next of kin as the first son of  my father.   so because of the present situation in my country cote d' ivoire , my mother advised me before she was mudered cold bloodedly with 18 of my sibblings to leave the country immediately for security reasons, and also to look for a trust worthy foreign partner who can assist me to transfer the money out of cotonou-benin republic to his private or company's account for investment as the security company had earlier rejected my application for the withdrawal of the money because i am underaged.   sir, i highly need your unreserved assistance both in transferring the money to your country and also investing it in a profitable venture with your kind advice,as i confide in you hoping you will never betray me at last.my guidian and myself have proposed \(20%\) percent of the total sum of the money for you as your own commission,and \(5%\) for any expensis that you might incure in the process so  that you can give us all necessary assistance and protection we may need in our investment in your country. please treat as highly confidential because our future depends on this money. all the vital documents covering the deposit of this fund in a security company are with me here in cotonou, and will be used to effect change of ownership in your favour for subsequent transfer to any account you may wish us to use abroad.   the identity of the finance company where the fund is deposited will be revealed to you as soon as i recieve confirmation from you on your willingness to proceed.even our family lawyer thatassisted my father when he was depositing the money has been approched on this issue and he promised to give us all the legal backing that might be required in this

am a sierra leonean national and the wife of late dr simon lamine. until his death, my husband was the general overseer of the diamond and gold mining corporation in kanema, sierra leone. on april 6 2000 the military forces loyal to the government of ahmed tijan kabbah invaded the diamond and gold mine and assassinated my husband, mistaking him for his brother mike lamine who is the deputy to the leader of the revolutionary united front (ruf ) foday sankoh. when the news reached me, i hurried gathered some valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear life in the company of my only son peters. among the valuables was a file that contained details of a deposit my husband made in a security company in europe. he deposited us$ 15.5 m  contained in 1 trunk box in the name of our son peters as containing family valuables. he did not disclose the real contents of the box to the security company. rather, he declared the deposit as family valuables for security reasons. this is the money he made from the sale of gold and diamonds during his time as the general overseer. we need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the  security company in europe for investment in your country as we cannot invest here due to its nearess to our country and the war still going on there. besides, our refugee status here cannot help matters for us. we also ask you to scout for a

oldest son of the al-bashar family, who are the descendants of ibrahim al-bashar ali from one of the oil rich areas in iraq. over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, saddam hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. in the wake of the gulf war of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. at the end of gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with america. we pray they remove saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from iraq without saddam knowing. the problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling us$12.5 million in cash from here. we are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs america is coming to baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in iraq is no longer worth living because of saddam. i have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a us marine. the private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. hoping the american campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your country for a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner. for your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation. we eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action. regards. eng. farouk al- bashar for the entire al-bashar family dear friend, acting on  consent and high recommendation from close associates i hereby contact you in the matter of an urgent confidential business transaction. before i proceed further let me introduce myself, my name is mr william okafor and i  am part of a group of five government officials still in active government

\($23million\) for ourselves which was accrued as a result of over-invoiced reciepts from sales of shares of other government parastals. we intend to transfer this fund out of this country to a foreign offshore account, but being that we are still in active government service, we are not allowed to transfer any money or own foreign accounts. inlight of this we have decided to solicit for

your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself, i am mr.james kabila the son of the late democratic republic of congo president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory.i know this letter might come to you as a surprise buti honestly do not intend to surprise you. i write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of us$35m(thirty five million united state dollars) with you.i inherited this money from my mother. this money was got through the smuggling and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state. my mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation.   when my father was assassinated on 16th jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards lt. rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him. i escaped to madrid, spain because of the fear that i might be arrested by my half brother lt.general joseph kabila the present head of state.actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children.my mother advised me to leave for madrid, spain where these funds were deposited for safe keeping with a private security company here in spain.on getting to  spain where i have been living since then as a political refugee, i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can come down to madrid, spain for a meeting and to clear the funds in his name as the sole beneficiary of the consignment as i was afraid of being defraud. honestly i contacted you because i don't want to invest this money in madrid spain due to my status here as a political refugee. and moreover i wouldn't want to take risk because this money is all that my mother and i are depending on. my step brother joseph,who is now the present leader of my country has seized all my father's assets and money. he left us empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited with the security company here. that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me. i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of investing this money with you. i expect you to be trust worthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future. and if you agree, i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 15% of the total amount of  $35million us dollars. when the money ($35 million) is moved into your discrete account. you will be allowed to draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 85% will be invested meaning fully for our future if possible in your area of business and different sectors of the economy in your country which are dividends yielding.whatever your decision is please reach me immediately,and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family. best regards,  mr.james kabila.  ___________________________________________________ yahoo! messenger - nueva version

filetime=[1ad78aa0:01c3041a] dayo naps 234 80 372 20807 dear sir, i am mr. dayo naps, an official with one of the apex banks in nigeria.my colleagues and i have an urgent and very confidential  business proposal for you. on the 6th of june 1998 an american miner, mr. travis myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at us$28,500,000.00 (twenty-eight million, five hundred thousand united states  dollars only) in my bank. we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. we therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr. travis myers did not  declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. this sum of $28,500,000.00 is still  lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. as it is now, no one  will ever come forward to claim this money. according to the nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money  will revert to the ownership of the government if unclaimed.  consequently, my proposal is that i would like you to stand in as the next of kin of mr. travis myers. this is simple; all  we need is some of your details so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as mr. myers's next of kin. we shall also employ the services of an accredited attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your  favour for the transfer. the money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. there is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as a manager  guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via email. please observe utmost

otherwise we'll take our  share .  awaiting your urgent reply. mr.dayo naps 234 80 372 20807  for ; thu, 17 apr 2003 18:30:28 -0400 (edt) message-id:  x-priority: 1 x-msmail-priority: high  charset="iso-8859-1" your strictest confidentiality and kind consideration highly required. greetings to you, with warm heart i offer my friendship, and i hope this mail meets you in good time. however strange or surprising this letter might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, i humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. also i duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as i make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. first and foremost i wish to introduce myself properly to you. my name is oliveira chuli savimbi, i am a nephew and personal assistant to late jonas malheiro savimbi, leader of unita (national union for the total independence of angola). as led by my instinct, i selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. i also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation.  my uncle (mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of angola, led by president dos santos, on friday 22nd february 2002. after his death, mr. antonio dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of unita, due to the lack of charisma my uncle had carried the party with in dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. prominent members like carlos morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including mr.dembo, planned to kill me. the tension and confusion in unita become uncontrollable when mr. dembo died 10days after my uncle's death. as i already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. i then desired a peaceful life, as i no more had interest in conflicts and wars. for this reason, i secretly left angola and came here (holla!  nd) to  seek for political asylum. i am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my uncle's money that arose from diamonds sales. this money (us$18.5million), which was already on its way to my uncle's swiss bank account, through the diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in amsterdam, holland in february last year when the tragic incident of my uncle's death occurred. i then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. i have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. as a matter of fact, the reason i came to holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the security company here in amsterdam.  president jose eduardo dos santos has lobbied the international community to freeze my uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground unita, and has already done this in angola. hence i cannot lodge the funds in my name. also i did not declare the funds to the government here. i plan to use this money to safeguard my future. it is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence i want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. your role in this project, is acting on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and i have permission to do business and open an account here.  for your reliable assistance, i will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money.  i have with me, the certificate of deposit for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. i thank you in advance as i anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. this will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.  http://www.the-idler.com/idler-02/3-16.html

pleasure involving you in this project. although, this  may sound strange but i seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously.    two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the ministry of  energy and mineral resources by my committee. this contract was over  invoiced to the tune of us$14.3million. this was done delibrately. the over  invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. we now  desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the memr  into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us.      for providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be  entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred  by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be  for my partners and myself.       i would require the following:    1\)bank details \( name and address & account no&beneficiary name \)    2\)private telephone and fax number of beneficiary       the above information would be used to make formal application as a matter  of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your  account. it does not matter whether or not your company does contract  projects of this of this nature described here, the assumption is that your  company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies.    more often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields  win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution  of such contracts. we have strong and reliable connections, top government  contacts at the south africa reserve bank and ministry of finance and we  have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get  the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. therefore, when the  business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw  all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100%  security. we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this  opportunity.     please contact me immediately through my above telephone or email contact,  whether or not you are interested in

2003 11:07:26 -0400 (edt) good day, with warm heart i offer my friendship, and my greetings, and i hope this letter meets you in good time. it will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. however, i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which i propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity. my name is mr.mako okere, the first son of iko okere,one of the most popular black farmer from zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. as led by my instict, i decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means i can contact anybody since i am cutting off ties with zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. however,i apologize if this is not acceptable to you. the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. due to the the land and political problems in zimbabwe, as a result of president robert mugabe's introduction of new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father forsaw the danger that came in zimbabwe. before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in  dollars and sold up our shares in major companies. we then went to johannesburg, south africa to deposit the sum of us$14.5 million (fourteen million, five hundred thousand us dollars), in a private security company. this money was deposited with this private security company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in botswana and swaziland. president mugabe's support for the violent imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. i was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. i resited for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and i survived two murder attempts, i fled zimbabwe to south africa where i was arrested and detained for eight(8 good month)in jail.i fled south africa for the netherlands with the help of the present prison command chief officer in charge(p.c.c.o) i am currently staying in the netherlands where i am seeking political asylum. in fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from south africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposit from their office in johannesburg here. i need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. since the law of netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial ransaction, this is why i am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, ence this proposal to you.you have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. if you accept to assist me, all i want you to do for me, is to assist with the arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in the netherlands, as it has now been transfered from johannesburg, south afri!  ca to their branch here. the company will be legally informed of you representing me. for your assistance, i have two options for you. firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. i have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for charity donation. if you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the account here for me. please, i want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.i look forward to your reply and co-operation, and i thank you inadvance as i anticipate your co-operation. thanks and god bless. sincerely, mako okere mime-version: 1.0 this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not met.the message could be strange but real if you  pay some attention to it. please accept my sincere apologies.in bringing this message of goodwill  to you, i have to say that i have no intention of causing you any pains. my name is senator gbenga aluko, the executive chairman pension funds committee in the senate of the federal republic of nigeria. i am writing you  to earnestly solicit your assistance in helping to receive some sum of money. i got your e-mail address on the internet while searching for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction. the proposition:  we have the sum of us$9,000,000.00 (nine million dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of a foreign partner.this money came as a result of the  unclaimed pension funds belonging to a british expatriate petroleum  engineer with the nigerian national petroleum corporation,engr.john  bruno. after all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of us$9,000,000.00,with the debt  reconciliation committee.  in a bid to make sure engr.john bruno gets his due,i sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the nigerian national petroleum corporation that engr.john bruno died, from an automobile accident.on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that engr.john bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his  official documents.this sum of us$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in an account of the debt reconciliation committee and the interest is being  rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.no one will  ever come forward to claim it.  according to nigerian law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money  will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody  applies to claim the fund. consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to engr.john bruno so that the  fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some  corrupt government officials.this is simple, i will like you to provide immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so  that i can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will  put you in place as the next of kin to engr bruno. upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in  your favor from a federal high court.a bank account in any part of the  world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money  to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio  of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences  incured,during the course of this transaction. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done at the high court and my position as the chairman of the  committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.the  fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down  procedures governing transfer of funds.if you are interested, please reply  immediately via my email address.  upon your response, i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the  transaction.please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because  i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. awaiting your urgent reply via my email address. thanks and regards, sen.gbenga aluko dear friend,

industry on your credibility, i decide to contact for the assistance. regarding my zeal toward foreign investment and security for my life and possession, i therefore write to you a break down of this proposal. my father died when a group of rebel soldier led by sir foday sankoh overthrown government of sierra-leone forcing the president out of power and killing many members of the cabinet and minister including my own father. when it become apparently obvious that the country no longer safe for the citizens due to the political war and massive killing and destruction of properties, i decided to move to holland with a treasure containing the sum of us$12.500.000.00(twelve million five hundred thousand united state dollars) through a diplomatic means, this fund is the last tangible money my father left behind before his death. the said amount is presently in holland (the netherlands) where i am currently seeking political asylum. while the consignment containing the fund is in the custody of the diplomatic courier company they are not aware of the content as it was deposited as personal effect and artifact. i am seeking for partner who will serve as a the guardian of this fund with whom i could plan the best way to move this money out of holland for investment which is my main purpose of contacting you. thus i decided to offer you 20% of the total money for assisting me to actualize this project while 10% of the money has been set aside to offset any incidental expenses that might incurred during the course of this funds and the balance 70%shall be for me and my family which shall be invested in your country. and are will visit you country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment. i shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.

was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of angola, led by president dos santos, on friday 22nd february 2002. after his death, mr. antonio dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of unita, due to the lack of the charisma my uncle had carried unita with in dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. prominent members like carlos morgado lobbied to depose dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including mr.dembo, planned to kill me. the tension and confusion in unita become uncontrollable when mr. dembo died 10days after my uncle's death. as i already lost my uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. i then desired a peaceful life, as i no more had interest in the war. for this reason, i secretly left angola and came her!  e  (holland) to seek for political asylum.  i am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my uncle's money that arose from diamonds sales. this money (us$18.5million), which was already on its way to my uncle's swiss bank account, through the diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private security company here in amsterdam, holland in february last year when the tragic incident of my uncle's death occurred. i then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. i have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. as a matter of fact, the reason i came to holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the security company here in amsterdam.  since president jose eduardo dos santos has lobbied the international community to freeze my uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground unita, and he has already done this in angola, i cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. also i did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year.  i plan to use this money to safeguard my future. it is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence i want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.  your role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the security company, since i can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker.  after the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and i have permission to do business and open an account here.  for your reliable assistance, i will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money.  i have with me, the certificate of deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.  i thank you in advance as i anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.  please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. this will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.  http://www.the-idler.com/idler-02/3-16.html   http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm

    re: confidential dear sir&ceo, i am, dr. paul babs, a director with the nigerian national petroleum corporation contract award monitoring committee. it is with trust and confidence that i make this urgent and important business proposal to you on behalf of my colleagues . actually,i would have contacted you by surface mail but for the urgency and the confidentiality this transaction demands hence i decided to contact you via email. my colleagues and i are members of the contract award committee\(cac\) of the nigerian national petroleum corporation \(nnpc\). my colleagues have mandated me to look for a trustworthy company into whose account some funds is to be transferred. we are in our possession vital approved documents to remit the sum of twenty-six million five hundred thousand united states dollars \(us$26,500,000.00\)incurred from returns of our opec oil sale which we want to transfer to a reliable safe foreign bank account in your country for our mutual benefits, as we intend to invest into lucrative business venture, in your country with your advice all we require from you is to provide us a safe bank account for the remittance of the fund and also to help source for lucrative long term investment to invest part of this fund. we are willing to offer to you upon negotiation an aggreable percentage of the total sum and profit accruing from investment plans. we are absolutely sure and positive that this arrangement will be of mutual benefit to us, and we crave your indulgence to treat this proposal with utmost trust and seriousness. we will fly over to meet with you, as soon as the money is transferred to your account for the disbursement of the fund and business plans, please note that this fund in question is not an illegal money, as all vital approved papers for the transfer will be sent to you as soon as we receive your banking information such as completed particulars of the bank account where you wish the fund to be transferred. the nature of your company=3fs business is irrelevant to this transaction, as all arrangements have been concluded for a successful and hitch-free transaction. we have taken measures to ensure that there is no risk involved on both parties=3b we have estimated that this transaction will be concluded within 14 working days on receipt of your acceptance to this proposal. most important to send back to me now: your

transfer shall be made at the appropriate ministries in favour of the beneficiary \(you or your company\). thereafter, your company shall be officially regarded as having executed the contract for the nigerian national petroleum corporation \(nnpc\) for which payment is being made. this process makes the operation legal according to the laws of the federal republic of nigeria. please treat this transaction as strictly confidential,as we are civil servants who are not entitled to operate a foreign account. while thanking you for your envisaged co-operation. i await your immediate response through email address or fax. best regards, dr. paul babs. p&s . copy your response to both email addresses above. --===_secatt_000_1fqbuqvldginux content-disposition: attachment; filename="1007.txt"

--25f2baccada04cfb13b6cd9831caf084-boundary  charset=windows-1256 content-disposition: inline dear sir , i am mrs. mrs. grace abba-ganna, personal accountant to late chief bola  ige(san) the attorney general of the federation and minister of  justice, who wasrecently assassinated at his country home on the 23rd  december, 2001 by assassins (may his gentle soul rest in peace) amen. before his death,he entrusted a certificate of deposit valued  us$10,000,000 (united states ten million dollars), with a security company  in  europe.he told me that this money was deposited for him by the former  military head of state rtd. general ibrahim babangida to protect his  interest not to appear at the oputa panel for re-conciliation and human  rights violation investigation commission headed by rtd. justice chukwudife   oputa. my reason of contacting you is for both of us to join heads and hands together to make claim over the us$10,000,000, as this money was deposited on my favour at the security company as instructed by the  late attorney general, to avoid trace of his name over accepting such gift   or offer. his intention before his death was to contact a foreign partner who is trust worthy, capable of handling such huge amount of money and also operate a foreign account where the money will be deposited or paid into waiting for his retirement. the reason is because our country law states that civil servants are not entitled to operate foreign  accounts. as it is now, with your full co-operation both of us can make claim over the us$10,000,000, what is expected of you is: (a) your full name and address  (b) your phone and fax number (c) your international passport or drivers license and your readiness to appear at the security company to sign off the money to your personal account. as soon as i confirm your interest, i will forward to you the certificate of deposit, power of attorney/transfer which will give you  legal backing to make claim over the money at the security company. i  will also forward to you the contact particulars of the security company  and letter of agreement between both of us over the security of my fund  that will be in your custody. for accepting to help out 30% of the us$10,000,000 will be for you, 60% for me and 10% set aside for re-imbursement of expenses incurred by both parties during the transaction. awaiting your urgent response. regards, mrs. grace abba-ganna alternate email gabbagana@yahoo.com  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------this e-mail was sent through

assistant to the late head of state of federal republic of nigeria - general sani abacha.i am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship. my husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several billion united states  dollars from the nigeria government. the current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us. fortunately, al mustapha my husband has six million and eight hundred thousa nd united states dollars(us$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. this money is kept in a private security company.  this money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad  for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. it is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept.  due to the current situation in the country concerning government's vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband. note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out financial transactions without their  express permission is in force. right now, my husband (al mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained in connection to the above and other activities of his late boss. however, i have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you  will only take the commission that we will offer you. this money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still  be used for investment. no record ever existed concerning this money, nei ther is the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation concerning the funds in the federal treasury.  the freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as so on as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall  formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement with them to air lift the consignment for your pick up. bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we  propose a commission of 15%(fifteen percent) of the total sum to you for  the expected services and assistance. while 5% is mapped out for miscellaneous expenses. on your positive consent, i shall expect you to contact me urgently to  enable us discuss about this.your urgent response is highly needed. i must  use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep  this matter extraordinarily confidential, while i await your prompt response. best regards, mrs. salatu al mustapha     get your private, free e-mail from indiatimes at http://email.indiatimes.com  buy the

i discorvered a floating fund in an account opened since 1993 and also since 1996 nobody has operated this account again. after going through some files in the record, i discorvered that the owner account died without a living =5bheir=5d, hence the money has being floating and if i do not remit the money out urgently it will be forfeited to the goverment for nothing. the owner of the account mr allan miller,a foreigner and an industrialist,died since 1996 with his wife who is his next of kin,that is why nobody has come to ask for the money, my investigation proved to me as well that the late allan seaman until his death was the managing director of diamond safari  =5bpty=5d sa. with the particulars that you will provide, i will change all his banking docs to yours and start the fund transfer process to your account,but first you have to give me your word that you will not let me down like i said before and also agreement signed between us. we will start the first transfer with

states dollards, =5b$6,800.000.=5d into your account bringing the total to twelve million eight hundred united states dollars =5b$12,800.000.=5d.  i am contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreigner with valid international passport, drivers particulars and with foreign account because the fund is in dollars and the former owner of the account,late mr allan seaman is a foreigner. i will like us to sign a binding agreement that will bing us together in these deal, i am revealing this to you with the believe that you will not let me down, you are the first

values which eventually go into their private bank accounts. what interest me most and for which reason i am writing you is this particular contract which was awarded to a foreign contractor, it was over estimated by the tune of us$ 5m \(five million u.s.dollars\). this contract has been completed and commissioned and the contractor fully paid,but the us $ 5m over estimated value of the contract is still lying at the central bank of nigeria \(cbn\). because of the haste with which the last government was removed from office, these men has no chance to collect this money before leaving the office. but as a result of updated payments advise at the central bank of nigeria \(cbn\), it has been awaiting transfer to a foreign account. in my report, i recommended that this money should be paid but on the condition that the contractor should be informed. my recommendation was accepted and i have been given the go-ahead order to get in-touch with the foreign contractors, but since the contractor has been fully paid for the job hedid, i want to divert this money to another foreign account. having done all the necessary ground work, this money is in my possession and i am looking forward for a trust worthy person into whose private or company's account this money will be transferred into. i wish to retire from service after this transaction and go in to business in your country through you as my agent. you are therefore requested to kindly allow me to transfer this money into your account so that i can withdraw this money when i want to. upon the transfer of this money, 65% of the total sum will be for me and my colleagues while 30% shall be for you the account owner and the remaining 5% shall be set aside to refund expenses made in the course of this transaction. be assured that this business is risk-free but the keyword is the confidentiality due to the nature of the transaction and my positionin the ministry. kindly treat as urgent and contact meimmediately through my tel:234-1-7763021 or 234-8033333606 you will be fully detailed when i hear from you. your banking particulars, i.e account number, telex, beneficiary, and your private

http://www.portugalmail.com/gold/ this is a multi-part message in mime format --f247f949-5be3-414f-a32b-c2492ca5b349 hello, i am sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you as we have not  had any correspondence before this letter. i got your address through my  nephew   with nigerian military chamber of commerce industry and mining  during my research for a reliable and trustworthy

state, general  sanni abacha who died on the 8th of june 1998 while still on active duty. i  am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to  each other likeness developing a cordial relationship.  i currently have within my reach the sum of twenty - five million us dollars  (us$25,000,000.00) cash which l intends to use for investment, like real  estate

russian partners returned my husband's share of usd$25,000,000.00 after  the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which  l am director right now, the new civilian government have intensified their  probe on my husband? financial and oil company. in view of these, l acted  fast to withdraw the us$25,000,000.00 from the company vault and deposited it  in a security company. i have since declared the security company bankrupt.  no record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government  because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the  russian.  due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude  towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this  money within. let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of  10th march 2001. you can check it through their website www.thisdayonline.com  the present government in nigeria had frozen and

of this  transaction. your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further  contacts. all correspondence must be by the email address  mariamabacha200@ecplaza.net i will give you my tel numbers where you can  contact me when i hear from you.  i must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence  to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision

my branch. upon maturity,i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. barry kelly died on 1 february 1997 in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft name hawker siddeley hs-748. this crash happened in tambacoumba, senegal, africa

offer my friendship, and my greetings, and i hope this letter meets you in good time. it will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. however, i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which i propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  my name is  owen mubane, the first son of mapele mubane, of the  most popular black farmer  from zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my country. as led by my instict, i decided to contact you  through email, after searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means i can contact anybody since i am cutting off ties  with zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  however, i apologize  if this is not acceptable to you. the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a business venture. due to the land and political problems in  zimbabwe, as a result of president robert mugabe's introduction of  new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw the danger that came in zimbabwe. before he was  murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares in major companies. we then went to  south africa  to deposit the sum of us$14.5 million  (fourteen million, five hundred thousand us dollars), in a private  security company. this money was deposited with this private security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to be used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new  farms in europe. president mugabe's support for the violent  zimbabwean war veterans  and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father and other innocent lives. i was continually threatened to  abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. i  resited for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and i  survived two murder attempts, i fled zimbabwe.  i am currently staying in the netherlands where i am seeking  political asylum. in fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is  because the security company from south africa, has a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in johannesburg down  here. i need to transfer this money to  an account and invest part of  the money. since the law of netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any  financial transaction, this is why  i am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal to you.you have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this money. if you accept to assist me, all i want you to do for  me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company from their office here in the netherlands, as it has  now been transfered from johannesburg, south afri!  ca to their branch here. the company will be legally informed of you  representing me. for your assistance, i have two options for you. firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money in your country. whichever the option you want, please to  notify me in your reply.  i have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for charity donation. if you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the account here for me. please, i want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of this transaction.  i look forward to your reply and co-operation, and i thank you in  advance as i anticipate your co-operation.you can reach me on my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via email owenmubane1000@rediffmail.com.   sincerely,   owen mubane.   note:  you can read about problems

you and the reason for my reaching out to you. i am muhammed abacha the the son of the late military head of state general sani abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of june 1998. following the death of my father gen. sani abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the american government under the leadership of president clinton. with the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new president of nigeria, olusegun obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.i was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since i have been in detention(the past 3 years). on monday the 24 september 2002,i was released,on the condition that i will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $i.5b,which i agreed. now i have been released but kept under severe house arrest,i had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. presently, i am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and i am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because i cannot afford to let this goverment know that i still have funds stashed away. shortly, before my detention i hurriedly deposited the sum of usd35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. i have since had this amount stashed away in a private security company in europe. i cannot send this money to any of my bank account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier. i hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. i will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where i can easily utilise it. the present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that i am under surveillance and i cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. i intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country.  that is why i am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.arrangements are being concluded with the security company which has branches in europe to receive the money in cash. i cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. however you can get more information by checking the following web; links. http://allafrica.com/stories/200010230279.html

a pleasure involving you in this project. although, this  may sound strange but i seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously.    two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the ministry of  energy and mineral resources by my committee. this contract was over  invoiced to the tune of us$14.3million. this was done delibrately. the over  invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. we now  desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the memr  into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us.     for providing the

co-operation.     yours faithfully,  engr.zulu makaleni.       my dear, it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co-operation and  assistance in the context stated below:may i first introduce my self: i am dr.\(mrs.\) mariam abacha,the wife of late general sani abacha \(former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria\) who died suddenly on 8th june 1998. i got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works  with the canadian chambers of commerce and tourrism,due,i did not disclose  to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my  life and my children. having noted the confidence reposed on your person by  the sponsor of the recommendation, i became convinced of your capability  and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us$20 million secretly  willed in my favour by the late general \(my husband\). this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have  all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for  safe keeping.this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to  avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.we have been deliberating on  how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a  conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for  non-speculative investments in your country.however,the current civilian  administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo\(the president of the  federal republic of nigeria\) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail  sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. in pursuit of  this vendetta,the present government have resolved to freeze all known  assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and  are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband  in switzerland,uk and australia. in fact, the attack on our family \(the  abacha's\) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling  passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in  court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..my first son mohammed abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 billion to the federal government of nigeria allegedly stollen by my late husband.we are not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts abroad have been freezen by the obasanjo regime. in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival,our  family trustee have secretly protected the will,the security company has  called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the  demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas  amount, hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come  to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation.in the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us\(the whole  family members\) and our local accounts are seized. we are currently living  on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the  sins of my late husband. in view of this plight, i expect you to be  trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me  and my children from a hopeless future. and if you agree to help, we will  compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of  the total amount of $20 million us dollars. in that case, when the money \($20 million\) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure  \(there are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by  you.\)during the process of securing this fund. the remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future.  my cousin \(kadiri mohammed\) has perfected arrangements with the trust  company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe  operation.what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance  company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide  owner. and in due course, all contacts must be made through dr.kadiri mohammed through his telephone: 234-8033333606 e-mail address: kadiri=5fhammed=40zwallet.com or kadiri=5fhammed2=40zwallet.com i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co-operation. in view of all above details, i request you to keep this

of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. the business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you  treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. i have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or  my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. if you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal i want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to

sir,     i am making this contact to you on the fact that we may be of assistance to each other in  developing a long lasting cordial business relationship. i was moved by the recommendations made  of your sincerity to handle a business relationship that involves huge money on trust. i was  constrained by the sudden death of my husband, the former minister of power and steel and  currently before his death, the minister for justice of my country, whom was assassinated by an  unknown men.  i am mrs. amina ige, the second wife of the late mr. bola ige who died on december 23rd 2001.  with heart full of grief, i regret to inform you of the inhumane and harsh conditions which my  husband's first wife and the brother's have subjected me and my only son, mr.ahmed j. bola ige  \(jr.\).since my husband's death, the relatives have been wicked to us because of the following  reasons:     1. i am not from the same tribe with them. 2. my refusal to learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other women from their tribe.  3. my refusal to accept their religion  4. because i have only one child, a male child. 5. because i was specially loved and favored by my late husband.   i am absolutely tired of all these threats from my husband's relatives since the death of my  husband. i am no longer in their family house. i am now in my husband's guesthouse, with my son,  i seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations.  few weeks before my husband's death,  he entrusted the cash sum of $85 million u.s dollars to my care for safe keeping in my apartment.  after his death i acted fast to deposit in a private security company vault to avoid my husband's  relations getting to see it in the house. this sum is secretly concealed in boxes.   now i solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. this i cannot lodge into a  local bank account to avoid suspicion from the government, my husband's brother's and wife  since they have confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they  could lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my child without any cash. if you can accept this, i urge you to contact us immediately for us to brief you on arrangement on how  we can possibly handle this. as a necessity you will also assist us in buying a good building in your city as we are presently in the guesthouse. since i am interested in investing on farm,  estate development, shares&stock exchange market, computers and in the shipping industries.  i will like you to educate me on your country's companies income -tax policies, as a citizen  since my husband's oil allocation from federal government is still in force. 15% of the tatal money will be your commission, 5% for expenses and 80% for my family.  obviously, you will be our \(myself and son\) next of kin while in your country. i expect you to  give this a quick and urgent attention while i expect your response for more briefing from me,  but if on the other hand you consider your self not capable and fit of handling this because of  the volume of cash involved, you can hold confidential by informing me, hence i may approve your  contact of any of your trusted close confidant you feel can keep this confidential and capable of handling such because of his level of knowledge in investment and cash flow in business.  remember the confidentiality, as this is not for any third party, hence this should remain  between both of us alone. my son ahmed knows every thing about this business in case if you get  him on mobile and you are free to discuss the modalities with him. regards,     mrs. amina bola ige --===_secatt_000_1fabgdpducapvu content-disposition: attachment; filename="slam2.txt" --===_secatt_000_1fabgdpducapvu--

plc. lagos =96 nigeria.  i am the manager of bill and exchange foreign operations department of union bank of nigeria. i am writing following an impressive information about you through one of my friend who runs a consultancy firm. he assured of your capability and reliability, although i did not tell him the details of the business i want to do with you.  in my department we discovered an abandoned sum of  $11.5million dollars \(eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars\) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along side his entire family on 2002 e.a.s plane crash. since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his relation to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. unfortunately we learnt that all his immediate family members died along with him at the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim since the account is his private account. it is therefore upon this discovery that i and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into federal government account as unclaimed bill. the banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after seven years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed funds and will further be handed over to government. the request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a nigerian cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. we agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and i. i will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. please be honest to me.  therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the funds to you as arranged, you must apply first to my bank as next of kin of the deceased. upon receipt of your response i will send to you a text of the application with the name of the deceased and his country and other information about him. note this transaction is confidential and  risk free. as soon as you receive this mail you should contact me through my e-mail address or alternative email address ahmedmartins10=40juno.com  best regards ahmed martins. d  for ; sun, 18 may 2003 13:54:17 -0400 (edt)  for ; sun, 18 may 2003 06:13:45 -0400 (edt) dear sir, you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. i am gabriel kali, the first son of gadik kali, one of the most popular black farmers in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. i got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. before the death of my father, he had taken me to johannesburg to deposit the sum of us15.5 million (fifteen million, five hundred thousand united states dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland. this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr. robert mugabe introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob!   action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was one of the victims. it is against this background that, my family and i fled zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the nigeria where we are seeking political asylum and however have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of this country prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone. as the eldest son of my father, i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. the south african government seems to be playing along with them. i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of this country for!   fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries h ave similar political history. i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. if you accept to assist me and my family, all i want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the netherlands from south africa. but before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money i intend to use for investment. i have two options for you. firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. i have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of thi!  s transaction. if you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. contact me with the above e-mail address while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.  thanks, god bless you  yours faithfully,  gabriel kali.  for ; mon, 19 may 2003 13:02:21 -0400

somewhere in europe by us for senior iraqi officials before the war  in my country and i will disclose the location of this money to you as  we progress. after the first gulf war in 1991, america began to freeze all the  personal bank accounts of senior iraqi officials and our leaders quickly  withdrew their money from western banks and have them channelled into  south american investments. however my direct boss was uncomfortable with  the south american investments and he decided to have his fortune  secured in cash in safedeposit houses in europe which were latter used to buy  up paintings, diamonds and gold bars for him. presently, we have a  total sum of $15 million united states dollars($15,000,000.00) in a safe  deposit house in  europe and i am seeking your cooperation and assistance to withdraw this  money from the safedeposit house urgently and hide it for us until  things settle down in our country iraq. if you agree to be part of this project, we will give you 30% of the  total amount as your reward for this assistance and for keeping  everything top secret. i am confident that you will not expose me to the  british  and american invaders because your country and countrymen campaigned against  the invassion of our country and we consider you our friends and  sympathisers. it will be your absolute responsibility to hadle the withdrawal of this  money out of the deposit house and to scure our share of it for us  until we are free to come out of our hiding to meet you and collect our  share from you and we hope to count on you in this hour of

feel sorry for  me, because, i believe everyone will die someday.  my name is saidi fatou, a merchant in dubai, in the  u.a.e.i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer  which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for my health. it has defiled all forms of  medicine, and right now i have only about a few  months to live, according to medical experts.  i have not particularly lived my life so well, as i  never really cared for anyone not even myself but my  business. though i am very rich, i was never  generous, i was always hostile to people and only  focus on my business as that was the only thing i cared for. but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have  or make all the money in the world. i believe when god gives me a second chance to come  to this world i would live my life a different way  from how i have lived it. now that god ! has called  me, i have willed and given most of my properties  and assets to my immediate and extended family  members and as well as a few close friends.  i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul  and so, i have decided to give alms to charity  organizations, as i want this to be one of the last  good deeds i do on earth. so far, i have distributed  money to some charity organizations in the u.a.e,  algeria and malaysia. now that my health has  deteriorated so badly, i cannot do this my self any  more. i once asked members of my family to close one  of my accounts and distribute the money which i have  there to charity organization in bulgaria and  pakistan, they refused and kept the money to  themselves. hence, i do not trust them anymore, as  they seem not to be contended with what i have left  for them.  the last of my money which no one knows of is the  huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars  that i have with a bank in london.  i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.email me  at giversworld@fastermail.com  i have set aside 10% for you for your time and  patience. god be with you.  saidi fatou. _____________________________________________________________ get free email

was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons kongolo and nzanga out of democratic republic of congo \(drc\) to abidjan, cote d'ivoire where my family and i settled, while we later moved to settled in morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. however due to this situation we decided to changed most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of \(dr\) mr laurent kabila has made arrangement with the swiss government and other european countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. hence my children and i decided laying low in africa to study the situation till when things gets better, like now that president kabila is dead and the son taking over \(joseph kabila\). one of my late husband's chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the french government, and as such i had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. i have deposited the sum of twenty eight mllion united state dollars \(us$28,000,000.00.\) with a security company , for safekeeping. the funds are security coded to prevent them from knowing the content.  what i want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our behalf. acknowledge this message, so that i can introduce you to my son \(kongolo\) who has the layout modalities for the claim of the said funds. i want you to assist in investing this money, but i will not want my identity revealed. i will also want to buy properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments. may i at this point emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which i repose in you.

the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 25% the money was duly transferred into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in new york as we were reliably informed that mr. patrice miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else, that is how we lost us$27.5m to mr patrice miller. this time around we need a

--04f5036b-d7fe-4bfc-a801-3fa742ad9a6b-- dear sir & madam i am mr.chuks anthony,an account officer with stanbic bank of south africa. i have an urgent and confidential business proposition for you. on june  6, 1997, an american mining consultant&contractor with the south african  mining corporation, mr. ken power made a numbered time \(fixed\) deposit for  twelve \(12\) calendar months, valued at us$28,320,000.00 \(twenty-eight million three hundred and twenty thousand dollars\) in my branch. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to  his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the south african mining corporation that mr. ken  power died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out  that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin  was fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that  mr. ken power did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official documents, including his bank deposit paper work in my bank. this sum  of $28,000,000.00 usd is still sitting in my bank and the interest is  being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to south african  law, at the expiration of 5 \(five\) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the south african government if nobody applies to claim the funds. consequently, my proposal is that i would like you to stand in as the  next of kin to mr. ken power so that the fruits of this old man's labour  will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. this is  simple, i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so  that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will  put you in place as the next of kin. we shall employ the service of an accredited attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and  letter of probate&administration in your favour for the transfer. a bank account  in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary&next of kin. the money  will be paid into your account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me  and 40% for you. there is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will be  done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately email. upon your response,i shall then provide you with more details and  relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction. please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would  be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance  to invest my share in your country. awaiting your urgent reply. mr. chuks anthony

being made by the union bank to get in touch with any of the creek family or relatives but proved to no avail. it is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of late engr.

e.mail:ami44000@netzero.net tel:234-8034540228 dear sir,/madam i am lady sweetie amina usman, bank manager of zenith international bank of nigeria,adeola odeku branch,lagos . i have urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you. on june 6, 1999, an american oil  consultant/contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation, mr. barry kelly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at us$35,000,000.00 (thirty- five million dollars) in my branch. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. barry kelly died from an automobile accident. on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. barry kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. this sum of us$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. no one will ever come forward to claim it. according to nigerian law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund. consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foriegner to stand in as the next of kin to mr. barry kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. this is simple, i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. we shall employ the service of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. we would need you as a foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of mr. barry kelly to travel and claim this money in a security company based in europe or sub-regional african country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house to the bank.the money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. if you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. upon your response,i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. please furnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster communication. awaiting your urgent reply via my  email:ami44000@netzero.net thanks and regards, sweetie amina usman     ________________________________________________________________ the best thing to hit the internet in years - netzero hispeed!

chairman in the national electric power authority \(nepa\) in lagos, nigeria. my colleagues have  assigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the  sum of us $65,500,000.00 \(sixty five million, five hundred thousand u.s dollars\) which  arose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the general expansion of the kanji  dam thermal station on behalf of national electric power authority \(nepa\) for increased  energy generation to nigeria and some other west african countries. the contract was  awarded in 1998 during the late general sanni abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the  consideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. the contract has  been completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this  us$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the federal  government account. the favorable political&economic climate in this country now presented  an opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. i got your contact from a  commercial attached to your emabassy. this assurance gave me courage to link you up for  this particular transaction, and i hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. our contact in  the federal ministry of finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the  remittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and  further action will commence immediately we hear from you. we have agreed that after the  transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount  transferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be  for us. we decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you  feel satisfied at the end of this transaction. the nature of your business is not particularly  relevant for the success of this transaction. all we require is your willingness to co-operate  and assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your  account. all necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides  of both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than  fourteen \(14\) working days. however, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will  be related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the  money into your account. since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this  money into real estate, stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in  your country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as civil  servant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this  money is transferred into your account. please note that this business is strictly confidential  and must not be disclosed to a third party. this is necessary to avoid disclosure that may  jeopardize the transaction. finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any  questions, feel free to

nigeria plc) and i work under the director of foreign exchange operations (international remittance). i am contacting you presently because i need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us.  i have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been  declared "unclaimed" by the chairman and some members of the board of  directors of our bank. the money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, late engr. manfred becker, i was his personal account officer just before he died in the adc plane crash of 1996 in nigeria.  engr. manfred becker an american citizen was a contractor with the  federal government of nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company creek land contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. his closing balance in the bank, union bank of nigeria plc (us$40.million) has been tagged unclaimed because no relative of engr. becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. we have no knowledge of a next of kin. at this point i trust you can picture what the situation is like. we have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in nigeria. this invariably  is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military  equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate africa.  this of course, is senseless, hence my mission.  my colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating  persons that could be remotely related to engr. becker and we have been doing this  for about 4 years now. right now i am almost alone in this enterprise and i have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. i am hereby soliciting your assistance and i will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard.  we have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. the only thing we do not have is a safe account. we will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. we will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. you may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [union bank nigeria plc, lagos] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and i.  i make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. if you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way.  thank you and best regards.  mr. johnson elendu  alternative e-mail:

objective is the operation of foreign accouunts for states and highly placed citizens of my country and other countries, especially those at the helm of affairs, and successful business men.we also make sure the forex market is well controlled and checked. one of those highly and successfully placed citizen is joseph nanven garba, (major general rtd). until his demise, he held sensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one of the office he held , was the position of the personal assistant to the u.n secretary general, koffi annan. his death was a shock to the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreign accounts in our department which i mannage myself due to his position in the country. such operations of accounts is called "private banking" where the deposits will only be known to the owner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge. normally,65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned into the federal government account and 30%, 5% given to the family and bank respectively.  this is what the banking law and policy of my country states, when this is achieved i.e transfer of the federal government account part, the people at the corridors of power withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issues but make use of thesefunds for their personal and family use. this is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of the account and the family of the deceased. so i released the code of the account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit. since the code of the account is in between me and the deceased the fear of being checked is ruled out but i cannot make withdrawals from this account myself and that is where you come in. all you need to do for this transaction is to follow the procedure binding this contract together and i guarantee you it&#8217;s risk free. however your suggestions will be appreciated. regards wale f. williams nb alternatively you sent your reply through wale.caramail.com --

as surprise since i had no previous correspondence with you. i am the chairman tender board of independent national electoral commission \(inec\). i got your contact in the course of my search for a reliable person with whom to handle a very confidential transaction involving the transfer of the sum of $30,000,000.00 d0llars \(thirty million united states dollars\) into your private account for safe keeping the above fund in question is not connected with arms, drugs or money laundering. it is the product of an over invoice on contract awarded in 1999 by inec to a foreign company for the supply of electoral materials that was used for conducting 1999 election. the contract has long been executed and payment of the actual contract amount has been paid to the foreign contractor leaving the balance of us$30million dollars in a dormant account, which my colleagues and i now want to transfer out of nigeria into a reliable foreign account for our personal use. as civil servants we do not have the necessary foreign account machinery to successfully handle this transaction therefore it becomes necessary to source for a foreign company or an individual with the capability to act as the original beneficiary or the contractor. my dear, it is a good thing the president has endorsed the resolution passed by the senate that all foreign contractors owed by the federal government of nigeria should be paid. we will seize this good opportunity to support you as one of the beneficiaries to be paid. if you are interested in the proposal kindly get back to me by sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone and fax numbers, but if you cannot for any reason to handle this transaction i should be grateful, if you can introduce it to a reliable and trust worthy person in which in any case your interest will be properly taken care of. meanwhile, my colleagues and i have decided to share the money in the following ratio: 60% for my colleagues and i, then 30% for you the account owner and 10% for all local and international expenses that may arise in the course of this transaction. further details about this transaction will be discussed in the subsequent correspondence. this transaction is strictly confidential but 100% risk free. note also that the particular nature of your business is irrelevant to this transaction and this transaction is expected to be concluded within 21 working days since all local contacts and arrangements have been properly perfected for a smooth and successful conclusion of thistransaction. contact me via email with your contact telephone and fax numbers, so that i can call you for a discussion. thank you as i await your response. yours faithfully, fredrick mbonu  by perfectworld.mr.itd.um (3.6u) with esmtp id

very confidential transaction involving the transfer of the sum of $30,000,000.00 d0llars \(thirty million united states dollars\) into your private account for safe keeping the above fund in question is not connected with arms, drugs or money laundering. it is the product of an over invoice on contract awarded in 1999 by inec to a foreign company for the supply of electoral materials that was used for conducting 1999 election. the contract has long been executed and payment of the actual contract amount has been paid to the foreign contractor leaving the balance of us$30million dollars in a dormant account, which my colleagues and i now want to transfer out of nigeria into a reliable foreign account for our personal use. as civil servants we do not have the necessary foreign account machinery to successfully handle this transaction therefore it becomes necessary to source for a foreign company or an individual with the capability to act as the original beneficiary or the contractor. my dear, it is a good thing the president has endorsed the resolution passed by the senate that all foreign contractors owed by the federal government of nigeria should be paid. we will seize this good opportunity to support you as one of the beneficiaries to be paid. if you are interested in the proposal kindly get back to me by sending me your letter of acceptance along with your direct telephone and fax numbers, but if you cannot for any reason to handle this transaction i should be grateful, if you can introduce it to a reliable and trust worthy person in which in any case your interest will be properly taken care of. meanwhile, my colleagues and i have decided to share the money in the following ratio: 60% for my colleagues and i, then 30% for you the account owner and 10% for all local and international expenses that may arise in the course of this transaction. further details about this transaction will be discussed in the subsequent correspondence. this transaction is strictly confidential but 100% risk free. note also that the particular nature of your business is irrelevant to this transaction and this transaction is expected to be concluded within 21 working days since all local contacts and arrangements have been properly perfected for a smooth and successful conclusion of thistransaction. contact me via email with your contact telephone and fax numbers, so that i can call you for a discussion. thank you as i await your response. yours faithfully, fredrick mbonu this is a multi-part message in mime format --bf31504f-0a21-4a2f-b007-aa98ff9e942d dear sir/madam, i am mr. john coleman and my sister is miss rose coleman, we are the children  of late chief paul coleman from sierra leone. i am writing you in absolute  confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty  one million dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private security  trust firm in europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as  family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not  know the content as money, although my father made them to under stand that  the boxes belongs to his foreign partner. source of the money: my late father chief paul coleman , a native of mende district in the  northerh province of sierra leone, was the general manager of sierra leone  mining co-operation (s.l.m.c.) freetown . according to my father, this money  was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales. before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major paul  koroma and the combined forces of ecomog peace keeping operation that almost  destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the  civilian elected president ahmed tejan kabbah by the rebels. my father had  already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my  little sister and myself to be evacuated to holland netherland, with the  certificate of deposit he made with a security firm in europe through the aid of u.n evacuation team. during the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of  public and government properties by the rebel forces, the sierra leone mining  coop. was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. my father including  other top government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in  november 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian government of  ahmed tejan kabbah. as a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's  involvement in the air crash in januaryit dashed our hope of survival. the  untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related  complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have  spent a lot of money on her early this year . now my 18 years old sister and  myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help.  without any relation,we

that my father used his position as the former vice president to acquire and make a deposition of us$ 23 m {twenty-three million united states dollars} in a special security company in south africa. i immediately had to travel to south africa where a financial expert advised me on the best way to safe guard and realize usefully this funds without any problems from the south african authorities. this was to involve a foreigner, who will come down here to south africa, open a non-resident bank account where the money will be deposited for onward transfer to any nominated account overseas as foreigners are highly respected. this is why i am making this contact with you now though i am in amsterdam arranging for the best possible way to ensure the delivery of the consignment to europe

direction. note: the content of the consignment is us$ 23 million cash money, but the security company does not know the actual content of the consignment because it was deposited by my father with a declaration that the content is precious metals and diamond valued at us$ 23 m, and this was done with diplomatic immunity and for security reason, at the time, my father was still in government in my country zimbabwe. this transaction is basically risk-free for you; therefore, reach me, preferably with the above stated phone or fax number to ensure the security of this transaction. note that it is

and a retired military top officer in nigerian army that served under the past military regime. i was the financial secretary to the armed force ruling council (afrc). with my position as a  financial secretary, i was able to secure up to $146,000,000.00(one hundred and fourty  six million us dollars which i deposited with a finance and security company in a country that will be disclosed to you later as you indicate interest. i wanted to use this fund to context for the post of the president of nigeria in the next republic. immediately i got retired, i was converted from moslem to christian when i was preached the words of god through my cousin the pastor of my church i then gave my life to christ and became a born again christain. since i gave my life to christ, i had no rest of mind. some times i think of the souls i killed when i was a soldier and the dubious ways i diverted my country's money into my personal bank account. i then decided to seek the face of god for forgiveness and after fasting and prayer through divine revelation, the almighty god revealed to me that the only way i could have rest of mind is when i used my wealth to do the work of god.  i have been thinking of the particular thing to do for my god before this present civilian president of my country set up  a panel(honourable oputa panel) to probe the bank account of the past military officers like me. they suceeded in finding out the funds i have in my personal bank accouts in nigeria and they have seized all my money.i am still facing their charges but i have refused to disclose to them that i have such money somewhere and they can never find out because i want to use part of it to do the work of god. i have decided to use part of this fund for charity instead of loosing it to my government. i am presently under house arrest and my movement is restricted.the consignments that contained the money is now accumulating demurage in the country because the agreement time with the security company has passed. i have been  making arrangement to sneak out and clear it but i can not travel out now.i sent a message to the security company that i am sending somebody to come and claim the consignments.i want a honest christain who will not run away with my money and who will be honest to use part of the fund for things of god and let the name of the lord be glorify and so that i can have rest of mind as the lord told me.if you are interested in going to claim the fund,i will disclose to you where i deposited the money and every document to claim the fund will be fax to you. i am still making arrangement to see if i can sneak out of the country with my family.as soon as you claim the fund,please use half of it for god`s work and keep half of it for me till i come over to meet you. if you are interested in going,please send to me your full names,address to submit it to the security company as the person coming to claim the consignments.  i look forward to your
